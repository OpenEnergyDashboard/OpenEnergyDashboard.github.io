<div>
    <h1>OED Code Organization</h1>

    <p>The OED code base is organized into directories. Understanding the structure of this layout can help in working
        on the code.</p>

    <p>The project is organized into a number of subdirectories. The primary division is among:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Metadata, configs, and deployment information</li>
        <li>Frontend code</li>
        <li>Backend code</li>
        <li>Common code</li>
        <li>Deployment and Analysis Scripts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    <p>In the root directory, we have several metadata files. These are further organized by technology or purpose.</p>
    <h3>For Humans</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frontend Code</h2>
    <p>All frontend code is stored in <code>src/client/app/</code>. This is the code that actually runs in the user's
        web
        browser. See the <a href="./technologies.html">technologies</a> page for a diagram showing how this code is
        transpiled and minified prior to delivery.</p>
    <p>This code is contained in several directories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>actions/</strong> are the messages that components send to reducers to change the application state.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>components/</strong> are the React.js components which generate HTML that is displayed on the page.
            Components can be combined and composed to create the UI that is displayed to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>containers/</strong> connect the React.js components to the application state (managed by Redux)
            through props and dispatched actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>reducers/</strong> accept messages sent by components and change the global application state
            accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>style/</strong> CSS files for the website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>translations/</strong> defines the strings used to make OED multilingual.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>types/</strong> define the datatypes used throughout the frontend.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>utils/</strong> defines functions used across the application and some APIs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Backend Code</h2>
    <p>All backend code is stored in <code>src/server/</code>, except for the executable server, which is
        <code>src/bin/www/</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Beneath that, there are several folders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>data/</strong> functions to generate test data (not used directly by the application but for
            testing).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>middleware/</strong> middleware for dealing with web requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>migrations/</strong> contains SQL files that are used to upgrade between database versions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>models/</strong> contains classes which connect JavaScript code to the database so that routes can
            actually interact with data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>routes/</strong> contains functions defining the actual URLs that the server provides, which is how
            the frontend interacts with the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>services/</strong> contains scripts used by developers and administrators to modify the data in ways
            that are inaccessible through the web interface.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>sql/</strong> contains the database queries used by models to talk to the PostgreSQL database.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>test/</strong> contains the test code run for validation of OED.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>utils/</strong> contains utility functions and constants.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Common Code</h2>
    <p>All common code is stored in <code>src/common/</code>. This code defines data types which are in shared use
        between the client and the server.</p>
    <h2>Scripts</h2>
    <p>Scripts are stored in <code>src/scripts/</code>.</p>
    <p>The scripts are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>checkHeader.sh</strong> verifies that all source files have the MPLv2 legal header. It is run in CI.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>checkMeters.sh</strong> verifies if a file of IP addresses has meters that respond. Used for testing
            meters or before input of meters into OED. Mostly targets MAMAC meters that are web based.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>checkTypescript.sh</strong> verifies that there are no untyped JavaScript files in the client tree.
            It is run in CI.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>devcheck.sh</strong> runs all the checks (header, typescript, types and lint) in one easy step.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>devstart.sh</strong> starts both the webserver and Webpack, in dev mode (watches files and shows
            interactive)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>installOED.sh</strong> sets up OED, either for development for production, creating the database
            schema and installing dependencies. This is often run using <code>docker compose up</code> or some variant
            of this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>oed.service</strong> is a sample <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/"
                rel="nofollow">systemd</a> unit file which allows Linux system administrators to start OED on startup.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>refreshReadingViewsCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
            instance, with cron) which updates the daily view table that is needed to graph OED data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>refreshDailyReadingViewsCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
            instance, with cron) which updates the hourly view table that is needed to graph OED data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>sendLogEmailCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
            instance, with cron) which sends an email with information from OED logging since the last time this ran.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
            instance, with cron) which updates Mamac-brand pull-type meters.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>updateOED.sh</strong> To be run after pulling the latest version from Git. Grabs new dependencies
            and migrates the database.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other directories</h2>
    <p>You will see other directories in the OED code base as you install and work with OED. These are not normally
        changed by someone. A few noticeable ones are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>node_modules/</strong> is created during the npm install process and contains information on all
            node packages used.</li>
        <li><strong>postgres-data/</strong> is created during the PostgreSQL install process and contains the
            information
            about the database and all records stored. It is the one set of files that exist between runs of the Docker
            container and are linked from the Docker container to you regular file system. This is done so that the
            database
            settings and records exist between runs.</li>
    </ul>
