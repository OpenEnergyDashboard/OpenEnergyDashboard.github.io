	<h2 id="stopping">Stopping OED</h2>
	<p>If you are running in a VSC container, then you can simply click the green icon for the Remote Container and
		select "Close Remote Container". You can also shut the container down manually (by right clicking and
		choosing "stop") but that is normally only done if something went wrong in shutting down the container in the
		usual way.</p>
	<p>If you are running OED outside of Visual Studio Code then go to the terminal where OED is running, you can type
		^-c (control and letter c) together to stop OED. Note it is best to only do this once since a second time causes
		a force stop. An alternative is to use <code>docker compose down</code> in a second terminal that is in the same
		directory as where the install is happening. This can also be useful if you are having an issue with your docker
		container(s) since it cleans them all up. Normally, doing ^-z will put the process into the background. This
		does not work with a running OED.</p>

	<h2 id="goingOn">Seeing what is happening with OED</h2>
	<p>Sometimes OED will not act as you expect and you want to know what is going on. There are two normal ways to do
		this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The "nohup.out" file in the main OED directory shows all the logged messages. (If running OED outside Visual
			Studio Code then it is in the terminal where you started OED.) It is a good idea to be able to see this
			while you are running a version you are developing so you can tell when something significant happens. The
			messages can be informational where these are normal and not an indication of a problem. Any server side
			console.log output will be here.</li>
		<li>Any console.log output on the client side will show up in the web browser console.</li>
		<li>OED has the log file "log.txt" in the main OED directory. All logged messages and errors should be placed in
			this file. The newest messages are at the end. This file can get large over time so you probably want to
			focus on lines in the time frame you are interested (they should be timestamped).</li>
		<li>Using the Redux debugging tools in the web browser is also very valuable. It can also help to look at the
			traces. To do this you must enable it in the code. Go to src/client/app/index.tsx and do what the comments
			say to enable traces (comment out one line and uncomment two lines below). Please make sure you do not
			commit this change/include in a pull request. As the comments indicate, it would be nice to automate this
			process and maybe a developer will do this work and submit a PR.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="codeChange">Getting a running OED to recognize code changes</h2>
	<p>As a developer, you are often changing the code to see what impact it has on a running version of OED. In
		general, the system should recognize these changes and update the running version. If you change code under the
		client/ directory, the output will include a rebuild of the code. When that happens, the output
		will show this line if it worked. This will be in the terminal where OED is running or in nohup.out if you are
		working inside VSC.<br>
		<code>oed-web-1       | webpack 5.62.0 compiled successfully in 24100 ms</code><br>
		If it fails then you will see one or more failure lines (with failure in red) rather than success. It will also
		show that it is done rebuilding when you see the line:<br>
		<code>oed-web-1       | \<s\> [webpack.Progress] 100% </code><br>
		It is not safe to reload the new version in the web browser until the rebuild finishes. You must reload to see
		the new code. If you change code on the server side, you will not see a rebuild but after a few lines of output
		you will see:<br>
		<code>oed-web-1       | [INFO@2022-04-24T16:31:17.449Z] Listening on port 3000</code><br>
		and then you can see the changes. Since all these changes are on the server, you do not need to reload the web
		browser.
	</p>
	<p>Normally the output is seen quickly but it can take a little while for webpack to detect the changes. If it ever
		fails to do this you could shut down OED and restart it but it is generally much easier/faster to go into some
		file, add a space, remove the space and save the file. This change (that really does nothing) should cause
		webpack to start the rebuild.</p>
	<p>In several cases, developers on Windows have reported not having the code rebuild on save. It turned out that the
		code was not on the WSL/Linux partition (generally under /home). As described in <a href="wslSteps.html">WSL on
			Windows</a>, it is important to do this properly.</p>

	<h2 id="dbAccess">Accessing the database</h2>
	<p>There are two ways to access the Postgres database that OED uses. Through the docker container or through pgAdmin
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			To access the database from the docker database container (see <a href="gettingStarted.html#VSCInfo">info on
				accessing containers)</a>, execute the following command: <code>psql -U oed</code>. You will now be in
			the Postgres command line for the OED database. It is assumed that you know some SQL and Postgres command
			line controls if you use this method. One important one is <code>\q</code> which will get you back to the
			terminal by leaving the Postgres command system.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can also use the pgAdmin utility to access the database. For this method, you need to install pgAdmin on
			your device. The link to get the latest version is <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/">here</a>.
			Once you have downloaded and installed the correct version for your operating system, you need to enable the
			port for the connection to pgAdmin. This can be done by going to the docker-compose.yml file in the main OED
			directory and uncommenting the lines <code>ports:</code> and <code>-"5432":"5432"</code>. Note you must shut
			down and restart OED for this to take effect. You should now be able to open pgAdmin and access the database
			on localhost port 5432 by adding a New Server with these properties: <ul>
				<li>General tab:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Name: oed (or whatever desired)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Connection tab:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Host name/address: localhost</li>
					<li>Post: 5432 (should be default)</li>
					<li>Username: oed</li>
					<li>password: opened (unless changed in docker-compoe.yml)</li>
					<li>Save password?: enable if desired to log in again without password</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>A screenshot of the setup:</p>
			<p><img alt="PGAdmin setup" src="./images/pgAdminSetup.png"></p>
			<p>When Save, it will verify connection and then open up connection if all is correct.</p>
		</li>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that no matter how you access the OED database it is the live system so you can make changes that the
		running application will see (and damage the information too!). </p>
	<p>There may be times you want to backup/restore the Postgres data for OED. You can do it by</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Take a database dump (in the database Docker container terminal) with
			<code>pg_dump -U oed &gt; dump_$(date +%Y-%m-%d"_"%H_%M_%S.sql)</code>
		</li>
		<li>Restore a database dump by first copying the dump into the container with
			<code>docker cp /path/to/dump.sql container_name:/dump.sql</code> and then restoring it into the database
			with <code>psql -U oed -f /dump.sql</code>. The /path/to/dump.sql is the file with date & time created in
			the dump step. TODO Note someone should test/see if you really need to put it into the container first and
			this has not been tested since we went to working in the database container.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="singleTest">Rapid testing of a one or a few test(s)</h2>
	<p>When you make changes to OED or develop new tests, it may be the case that only one or a few tests fail when you
		run testing (or you want to focus on one test at a time that fails). Running all the tests is much slower than
		running a single test file. Thus, to run a single test, in the web/vsc docker container (see <a
			href="gettingStarted.html#VSCInfo">info on accessing container</a>) do:<br>
		<code>npm run testsome &lt;first test&gt; [&lt;second test&gt;] </code><br> where you replace &lt; xxxx test&gt;
		with the path to the test file you want to run and [ ] indicates this is optional and you can repeat as many
		times as you want for more tests.
	</p>
	<p>For example, to run the web groups test, you would use:<br>
		<code>npm run testsome src/server/test/web/groups.js</code><br>
		and to run the web groups test and the db baselineTests
		use:<br>
		<code>npm run testsome src/server/test/web/groups.js src/server/test/db/baselineTests.js</code>
	</p>
	<p>If you are using VSC you can easily get the path to any open test file. Right click on the file name in the tab
		for that editor window and choose "Copy Relative Path". This can then be pasted into the needed command.</p>

	<h2 id="resetDB">Resetting the Postgres database</h2>
	<p>During the initial install of OED, Postgres detects that you have not run before for this install and initializes
		the database system. It keeps the information in the postgres-data/ directory in the main OED directory. If you
		or a pull changes the database configuration, it will not automatically be changed on the next OED install. When
		we change versions of OED we use a migration system to upgrade the database but this may not be available during
		the development cycle. Given this, it is often easiest to force Postgres to reinitialize the database. Note that
		doing this will wipe out any data (meter, readings, preferences, etc.) that you have for this instance of OED.
		If you wish to force Postgres to reinitialize then do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the postgres-data/ directory from the main OED directory. While you can move it to keep a copy, some
			OSes will still use the moved directory as if it exists in the main OED directory (at least until a reboot).
			Thus, it is probably best to delete the directory. Also note that OED should not be running when you do this
			as it will cause all kinds of problems when it does not find this directory. OED will automatically recreate
			the next time you bring it up.
			<ul>
				<li>To delete this on Linux, you can do <code>rm -rf postgres-data</code> in the main OED directory.
					Note you may need to be root to remove this directory. If this is the case, use
					<code>sudo rm -rf postgres-data</code> where you will be prompted for the root password.
				</li>
				<li>It is sometimes tricky to know/login as root on a Windows WSL system. In this case, open the
					PowerShell, and enter the command <code>wsl -u root</code> that will put you in your WSL/Linus
					terminal as root. You can then directly delete the postgres-data/ directory. You should be very
					careful using this terminal as you can do damage as the root user.</li>
				<li>After you delete the postgres-data/ directory on Windows WSL, you will need to delete both OED
					containers (can do via the Docker Desktop or Docker extension in VSC). Doing a
					<code>docker compose down</code> in a terminal in the main OED directory will also accomplish this.
					Otherwise, you are likely to
					get the following error when you restart OED:
					<p> Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create
						failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting
						"/run/desktop/mnt/host/wsl/docker-desktop-bind-mounts/Ubuntu/c5c261024a2161c37bee3afcd0931bd36812e943519b816556c0bfbd60899ef2"
						to rootfs at "/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata": mount
						/run/desktop/mnt/host/wsl/docker-desktop-bind-mounts/Ubuntu/c5c261024a2161c37bee3afcd0931bd36812e943519b816556c0bfbd60899ef2:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
						(via /proc/self/fd/14), flags: 0x5000: no such file or directory: unknown </p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Do an install of OED by reopening it in the VSC container or doing it outside of VSC. Remember if package
			changes were made then it will reinstall the node_modules. Note the install will take longer do to the extra
			initializations.</li>
		<li>Sometimes the first attempt at installation will fail when you do this. Try it one or two times more to see
			if it will work. (We are trying to determine why this happens.) If not, replace the postgres-data/ directory
			with the one removed and this should get you running but will not give you a new version of the database. If
			you have this issue then contact us for help (see link at bottom of page).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>OED runs in the containerized Docker environment. This means the software and files created are within this
		container and disappear when you stop running OED (shut the container down). The one exception to this rule is
		the information stored in the PostgreSQL database. Because this information needs to exist between OED runs to
		keep the database initialization and OED data, the information is kept within your OED installation in the
		postgres-data/ directory on your machine's file system. This is why removing the postgres-data/ directory resets
		the database within the Docker container.</p>

	<h2 id="environment">OED environment variables</h2>
	<p>If you want to know about the environment variables that control OED then see the <a
			href="./environment.html">environment page</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="scripts">OED Scripts</h2>
	<p>OED has a number of scripts that are run via commands in the package.json file. A complete listing with
		descriptions is on the <a href="npm.html">NPM script</a> page.</p>

	<h2 id="migrate">Migrating OED</h2>
	<p>The script <code>src/scripts/updateOED.sh</code> should update all dependencies and migrate the OED database if
		changes are needed. This may not work (see ideas above) if migrations are not yet available or this has been
		done before for the same version of OED.</p>

	<h2 id="versions">Having multiple versions of OED</h2>
	<p>Most developers keep one clone of the OED software. They switch between branches as needed. However, if you are
		working on multiple versions of OED, esp. where the node modules are changing or the database configuration
		changes, then you can avoid having to do a full install (see above) by cloning separate copies of OED. When you
		install it will do the clone you are currently located in (the current directory in your terminal). The database
		information and all code is kept separate for each installation as part of the Docker containerization. Note you
		cannot run multiple version of OED simultaneously unless you change the ports it uses (this is not common).</p>

	<h2 id="rebuild">Rebuild after Docker dependency changes</h2>
	<p>If a "From" in a Dockerfile is changed, then the version of that software needs to be updated. Docker normally
		uses its cached version so the update will not happen. To force the update, do:
	<ul>
		<li>Inside VSC run the command <code>rebuild container</code>.</li>
		<li>Outside VSC in a terminal do <code>docker compose up --build</code> where you can add other arguments (such
			as keeping the node modules). This is unusual in that it is done in a terminal on your own machine in the
			main OED directory and not in an OED Docker container (because you are resetting the Docker containers).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This should make Docker use what is specified in the Dockerfile. If there are no changes then it will not
		download a new version of the needed software but it will be a little slower for the checks and potentially
		creating the container. OED tries to announce to the Docker channel for developers whenever a change is make to
		a Dockerfile that would require this action. This is not commonly done.</p>

	<h2 id="noDb">Running without the database container</h2>
	<p>On rare occasions, you may get a database failure during the startup of the database container during the
		install/startup of OED. (This is not the transient issues noted during the install where the script reports it
		is continuing). Generally OED will tell you an issue happened in the console output and Docker indicates the
		database container is not running. In general, the underlying issue should be addressed so you have a correct
		OED installation. (This happened, for example, during Windows WSL installs until an file permission issue was
		resolved.) In rare circumstances, you still want to run the OED web container knowing that any operations that
		touch the database will fail. There is a parameter to the install script that allows this and can be done with:
		<br><code>install_args="--continue_on_db_error" docker compose up</code><br> or the full install script (not
		using docker compose up) of
		<br><code>docker compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh --continue_on_db_error</code><br>
		OED will still try to install the DB, fail and then continue to try to install the web container. You should see
		the regular messages in the console indicating the web container is running as expected. If you are working
		inside VSC, you will need to edit the src/scripts/installOED.sh script to add the --continue_on_db_error
		parameter.
	</p>

	<h2 id="typescript">TypeScript Wisdom</h2>
	<p>TypeScript is great, but sometimes it requires some rather strange incantations, especially when working with
		external libraries. We cannot provide information on everything you need to know but here is one of interest:
	</p>
	<h3>Regarding <code>InjectedIntlProps</code> from <code>react-intl</code></h3>
	<p>When using <code>react-intl</code>'s higher order component functionality, some incantations are required. When
		defining a component, it's necessary to express that the component's props are actually (your props) ∪
		(internationalization injector). This can be done via the <code>&amp;</code> operator, as follows:</p>
	<pre>
interfaceSomeProps {
    prop1: number;
}

interfaceSomeState {
    state1: number;
}

class SomeComponent extends React.Component&lt;SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps, SomeState&gt; {
    constructor(props: SomeProps: &amp; InjectedIntlProps) {
        super(props);
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

export default injectIntl&lt;SomeProps&gt;(SomeComponent);
	</pre>

	<p>If the union type is used often, it might be cleaner to create a type alias:</p>

	<pre>
type SomePropsWithIntl = SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps;
	</pre>

	<h2 id="testingTimeout">Database timeout on testing</h2>
	<p>Sometimes when you run the OED tests for the first time in a while, you get an error about the database timing
		out. The message is normally something similar to "Error: Timeout of 15000ms exceeded. For async tests and
		hooks, ensure "done()" is called; if returning a Promise, ensure it resolves." If this happens, rerun the test
		command. It normally works the next time (or within a total or three tries). We are working to change our
		testing and installation so Postgres is ready before operations continue so this problem will go away. The
		current fix is to allow a test to take up toe 15,000 ms or 15 seconds to complete so Postgres has time to start
		up and that is why you see "15000ms" in the error message. We have also set the timeout to be longer in a few
		tests where the issue was happening. If the problem persists, you can go into package.json and change the 15000
		to be a larger value (such as 30000). This means mocha will not terminate a test until 30 seconds have passed.
		The only known negative of doing this is that a test that will not complete due to an error will take longer for
		mocha to terminate. However, this is uncommon in OED tests so the change should be fine.</p>

	<h2 id="npmPermission">check permission error (historical)</h2>
	<p>A few developers have reported that when they run <code>docker compose run --rm web npm run check</code> they get
		an error similar to "Error: EACCES: permission denied, scandir '/root/.npm/_logs". We do not believe this will
		happen any longer now that developers are asked to work within the Docker container. For the historical record
		the only know fix was to run outside of docker by doing <code>npm run check</code>. It is believed that this
		issue is due to doing installs as root and then not being root when inside docker but this is not certain.
		However, at least one developer found that changing the file permissions did not fix the issue. If anyone has
		this issue or finds a solution then please let us know.</p>

	<h2 id="fastInstall">Faster OED installation (historical)</h2>
	<p>The installation process was updated in late February 2022 so the node modules are not updated unless needed.
		This means the node modules will only be updated if the package.json and/or package-lock.json file is update
		whether by directed edit or from pulling updating versions. As a result, the old method of
		<code>install_args="--keep_node_modules" docker compose up</code> should not be needed if you are running
		current versions of OED software. The <code>keep_node_modules</code> parameter was left for backward
		compatibility and in the unlikely case where a developer wishes to use it. As expected, the steps and output is
		different when there is no node module installation as seen in <a href="noNPMInstallOutput.html">skipping NPM
			install output</a>.
	</p>
