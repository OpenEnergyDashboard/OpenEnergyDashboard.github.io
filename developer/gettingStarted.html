    <h1>Getting started as an OED code developer</h1>
    <p>The following steps should get you ready to contribute to OED in a fairly short period of time. Please know that
        we are here to help you so use the link at the bottom of the page to email us with any issues.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we strongly encourage you to <a href="mailto:developer@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact us</a> as a
            potential developer. That way we know about you and can help you select tasks that will be interesting to
            you and also benefit the project.</li>
        <li>Before you can submit work to OED, you need to sign the <a href="cla.html">Contributor's License
                Agreement</a>.</li>
        <li>The OED project resides on <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> so you need a
            login to contribute to the
            project.</li>
        <li>OED uses the fork model for development. (There are many descriptions of this process on the web but GitHub
            ones include a <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" rel="noopener noreferrer">general
                one</a> and one with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">more operational
                details</a>.)
            This means you need to go to the main OED GitHub page (after login
            to GitHub), fork the
            project onto your own GitHub account and then clone the forked copy onto you own development machine to work
            on the
            code base. You can place the clone anywhere you want on your machine. Note the clone will place all the
            files inside a new directory named OED. This model has the advantage that you
            can commit and push to your account without needing write
            permission on the main OED project repository. There are <a href="pr.html">separate directions</a> of the
            steps for creating a
            pull request to integrate your code into OED.
        </li>
        <li>OED uses the Docker container system to run the software so you need to <a
                href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> and install
            Docker. (You need both Docker and docker-compose but you generally get those together during the
            install.) This
            has the advantage that our configuration
            files for Docker can get any needed software and also means we do not modify your normal system since the
            setup is in a separate container that does not impact other programs on your computer. Note that Docker
            should run on all OSes (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows) so you should be able to use it.</li>
        <li>You will want to install your cloned copy of OED on your development machine. While there is <a
                href="devDetails.html">further
                information</a> on more advanced options for doing this, the initial install can be done by following
            these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure you have Docker running on your system.</li>
                <li>If you are running a WSL Distro, make sure to enable WSL integration in Docker -> Settings -> Resources -> WSL Integration.</li>
                <li>Open a terminal on your computer (it is the "command prompt" on some Windows systems).
                    In the terminal do the following:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>cd "directory with cloned OED"</code><br>You need to replace "directory with cloned OED"
                        with
                        the location
                        of the cloned copy of OED. This is where the "README.md" and other main OED files are located.
                        Some people find it easiest to locate that directory using the file
                        manager on their OS and then use that information to get to the needed directory. As an example,
                        you
                        might do<br><code>cd /home/username/projects/OED</code><br>if you cloned OED in the
                        /home/username/projects/
                        directory.</li>
                    <li><code>docker-compose up</code><br>This will run the entire OED install process. Note that on
                        some systems (mostly some Linux systems), depending on how you installed Docker, you may get a
                        permission error so you will need to do:<br><code>sudo docker-compose up</code><br>which runs
                        the process with root privileges. If this is
                        the case then you need to do sudo before all docker commands on your system.<br>
                        Depending on the speed of your machine and internet
                        connection, this can take a few to ten minutes. It should go faster after the first install if
                        you follow the <a href="devDetails.html">developer details</a> elsewhere. You will see a lot of
                        output about installing
                        the database (Postgres), getting needed packages (this can take a while so you may not see
                        output for a while) and starting up the web system. When you see the line:<br>
                        + 2073 hidden modules<br>
                        where the actual number will likely be different then OED should be running normally unless
                        there was an error in the output.
                    </li>
                    <li id="sendConsole">If you have any issues please copy all the output from your terminal and <a
                            href="mailto:developer@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">email</a> it to us. We wll look it over and
                        get back to you. We try to do that quickly.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Open a web browser. It should not matter which one you use. (Some developers prefer to work with
                    Chrome when debugging code due to their debugging tools but other web browsers have good tools.)
                    Enter the address:<br>localhost:3000<br>and load the page. "localhost" indicates the page is being
                    served up from your machine and "3000" is the default port that OED uses to accept web connections.
                    If all went well, you will see the main OED web page that looks something like:<br>
                    <img id="OEDMainPage" alt="OED Main Page" src="../images/OEDStartupMainPage.png" /><br>
                    If you see that then the basic OED install worked and your system is properly serving up the OED web
                    system.
                </li>
                <li>Though not common, it is possible for the OED web system to run without starting the underlying
                    database system. To verify that the database is running properly, you should log into OED as the
                    admin. The username and password were shown during the install process. By default they are:<br>
                    email: test@example.com<br>
                    password: password<br>
                    Yes, the password really is password but remember it is running on your local machine in a container
                    so it should not be accessible to others. Test by clicking on the "Log in" button in the top, right
                    corner of the main OED page. This will take you to the login page where you enter the admin
                    credentials and click "Submit". If it works you will have another button in the top, right of the
                    page for the "Admin
                    Panel". If it fails you should see a message appear briefly in the top, right corner of the page. If
                    this happens, please follow the <a href="#sendConsole">steps above</a> to email us the output in
                    your terminal.
                </li>
                <li>If all went well, you now have a fully running development version of OED that can be used to begin
                    coding. Congratulations!</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When you install OED, it does not have any data. An actual site would connect up meters to gather data. For
            a developer, we have standard test data you can use. The <a href="testData.html">OED test data</a> page has
            information and directions for doing this. We suggest you load up the data now so you can try any features
            you want in OED. Note that an advantage of this test data is that it is the same for all developers so
            people should be able to reproduce what you mention if you have a question or issue.
        </li>
        <li>You will want a coding environment to work on the OED code. We do not care what you use but note that many
            developers use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>
            that is freely available for all OSes.
        </li>
        <li>OED uses a number of technologies. You may want further information on these and some are provided on the <a
                href="learningTechnologies.html">OED technologies page</a>. We welcome your input on other areas you
            would like
            to know about or other resources you find valuable. Note that you can work on parts of OED without knowing
            many of the technologies in any depth. For example, you can work on database queries without knowing about
            the front-end. Thus, many developers begin in areas they know or want to learn first and focus on that
            needed information. Having said that, almost the entire code base is in JavaScript/TypeScript so a basic
            understanding of that is usually needed to get started.</li>
        <li>There are two areas on our GitHub repo that are worth noting. First, the <a
                href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/discussions" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion
                board</a> has several areas
            including one for developers. Second, the <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/projects"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> have an overview of the status
            of work and major initiatives.</li>
        <li>The <a href="work.html">What to Work on in OED</a> page can help you figure out what to do.</li>
        <li>If you want help or have questions about running OED, then see the <a href="../index.html">website</a> or <a
                href="../help/index.html">help pages</a>. </li>
