The update to the Redux Toolkit (RTK) is not yet reflected in the documentation. As a result, some information may be out of date. OED strives to have test code for all aspects of the project. At the current time we do not test the actual web pages. Thus, we don&#39;t automatically check that buttons click as expected or graphics show as expected. These tests are done manually. OED uses automated testing for functions, database query results, routes, etc. The automated testing mostly uses the Chai and Mocha frameworks. The test code is located in the src/server/test/ directory. Tests are grouped by functionality in database (db/ directory), routes (routes/ directory), etc. The main directory has common.js that is used across many tests. It has functions to set up the test database environment, reset the database and Mocha actions to take before/after tests and before each test is run. In general, the database is reset before any test that uses the database to guarantee a clean environment for each test. OED only uses a subset of the testing frameworks. Possibly the easiest way to learn how to add tests is to go to existing tests in OED that are similar to the one(s) you want to add. You can then either edit/add to an existing file (if you changed or added to an already existing feature) or create a new file (for new functionality) where you use an existing file as the template. Please make sure to run your test(s) to make sure they work. The developer details has information on running single tests. Some newer tests are outlined in the testing design document that describes how they are created, implemented and other details."><meta name="google-site-verification" content="Vk0IOJ2jwG_qEoG7fuEXYqv0m2rLa8P778Fi_GrsgEQ"><meta name="msvalidate.01" content="0FB4C028ABCF07C908C54386ABD2D97F" ><link rel="canonical" href="https://openenergydashboard.org/developer/testing/"><meta property="og:title" content="Test Code"><meta property="og:description" content="Documentation overview Developer documentation Information Overview Starting Developer First Steps Steps for WSL Contributor License Agreement Creating Pull Requests Test Data Work Selection Codebase Info Learn OED Technology npm scripts Technology Overview Further Details Code Organization Developer Details Documentation Expectations Environment Variables Full Install Output No npm/DB Install Output Test Code Version Release Releasing OED This information is for developers of the OED software so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.
