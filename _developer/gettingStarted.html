        <p>The following steps should get you ready to contribute to OED in a fairly short period of time. Please know
            that
            we are here to help you so use the link at the bottom of the page to email/message us with any issues.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we strongly encourage you to contact the OED project as a potential developer. You can join our
                Discord channel with this <a href="https://discord.gg/zP6nHVspet">Discord invite link</a> or <a
                    href="mailto:developer@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">email us</a>. That way we know about you and can
                help
                you select tasks that will be interesting to you and also benefit the project.</li>
            <li>Before you can submit work to OED, you need to sign the <a href="cla.html">Contributor's License
                    Agreement</a>.</li>
            <li>The OED project resides on <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> so you
                need a
                login to contribute to the project.</li>
            <li>If you are using Windows 10+ then you will probably want to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
                that
                allows Docker to run on Windows. Please see this page for the steps you need to follow <a
                    href="../wslSteps/">these extra steps</a>. Installing WSL before Docker is helpful with the setup.
                <strong>Please be sure to see the information on the WSL page (link earlier in this bullet) about using
                    the
                    Linux filesystem for OED and running Visual Studio Code under WSL if you are using Windows. You need
                    to
                    read this even if you already had WSL and/or Visual Studio Code.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>OED uses the Docker container system to run the software so you need to <a
                    href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> and
                install
                Docker. (You need both Docker and docker compose but you generally get those together during the
                install.)
                There are paid subscriptions but your non-commercial work on the OSS OED project does not require a paid
                subscription. This has the advantage that our configuration files for Docker can get any needed software
                and
                also means we do not modify your normal system since the setup is in a separate container that does not
                impact other programs on your computer. Note that Docker should run on all OSes (Linux, Mac OS X,
                Windows -
                see above for information on using WSL on Windows) so you should be able to use it.</li>
            <li>You are welcome to use any IDE for code development. Having said that, most OED developers use <a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSC). The
                OED
                repository contains the .devcontainer folder that allows VSC to automatically launch and set up the
                needed
                Docker containers. There are a number of advantages to this system including that it puts in the
                extensions
                that OED thinks are valuable, gives a guaranteed environment to work with OED and avoids you having to
                separately install OED. Thus, you are encouraged to <a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">install
                    VSC</a> (if you don't already have it. The directions for working outside VSC follow the ones for
                VSC.
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you have VSC installed, you need to add one extension to it so you can work with the OED
                        container. Click on the Extensions manager icon on the far left of the VSC window (<img
                            alt="VSC Extension icon" src="../images/VSCExtensions.png">), search for "Remote Development"
                        and
                        install it. You will get several Extensions included with this one.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>OED uses the fork model for development. (There are many descriptions of this process on the web but
                GitHub
                ones include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">general one</a> and one with <a
                    href="https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo" rel="noopener noreferrer">more
                    operational details</a>.) This means you need to go to the main OED GitHub page (after login to
                GitHub),
                fork the project onto your own GitHub account and then clone the forked copy onto you own development
                machine to work on the code base. You can place the clone anywhere you want on your machine but please
                note
                what is stated on the WSL page linked above about where it should go on WSL. Note the clone will place
                all
                the files inside a new directory named OED unless you put a "." at the end of the <code>git clone</code>
                command. This model has the advantage that you can commit and push to your account without needing write
                permission on the main OED project repository. There are <a href="../pr/">separate directions</a> of
                the
                steps for creating a pull request to integrate your code into OED. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Installing OED in Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you have Docker running on your system so OED can use it to get running.</li>
            <li>Assuming you are using VSC, you will do the following (steps to setup outside VSC are below):
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the cloned OED repository that is on your local machine in VSC by doing File -> Open
                        Folder...
                        You need to open the main OED folder that was created when you cloned OED. It has the README.md
                        file, the src/ directory, the package.json file and lots of other files. </li>
                    <li>Typically, VSC will ask if you want to reopen the folder in a container by showing this
                        message:<br>
                        <img alt="VSC container msg" src="../images/VSCContainerMsg.png"
                            style="width: 25vw; min-width: 200px;">
                        <p>You can click the button "Reopen in Container". You will often see a popup in VSC that
                            indicate
                            you can click to see the log:</p> <img alt="VSC container msg" src="../images/VSCDevLog.png"
                            style="width: 25vw; min-width: 200px;">
                        <p>The first time OED installs it can take a while where the time depends on the speed of your
                            machine and internet connection (to get the needed npm packages). You can see the output of
                            the
                            install and anything OED outputs to the console by looking at the file nohup.out that will
                            be
                            created in your main OED directory. If you open this in VSC it should update with new lines
                            at
                            the bottom as they are added. See <a href="../fullInstallOutput/">full install output</a>
                            or <a href="../noNPMInstallOutput/">install without Postgres or npm install output</a> to
                            see a
                            typical install output and for information if something goes wrong.</p>
                        <p>If VSC does not automatically ask to open in a container, you can click the "Remote
                            Container"
                            icon (<img alt="VSC Remote Container icon" src="../images/VSCRemoteIcon.png" width="32"
                                height="26" style="min-width:32px; display: inline">) that is normally in the bottom,
                            left of the VSC
                            window and select "Reopen in Container" for the menu that appears. </p>
                        <p>Once OED is running you should be able to see the web and database Docker containers. See <a
                                href="#VSCInfo">Useful VSC information</a> for more info on doing this.</p>
                        <p>You can shut down the OED VSC container by clicking the green icon for the Remote Container
                            and
                            selecting "Close Remote Container"</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
        </ol>

        <h3>Using OED</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once you have OED installed and running, you will want to open it in a web browser. It should not matter
                which one you use. Enter the address:<code>localhost:3000</code> and load the page. "localhost"
                indicates
                the page is being served up from your machine and "3000" is the default port that OED uses to accept web
                connections. If all went well, you will see the main OED web page that looks something like:</li>
            <p><img alt="OED Main Page" src="../images/startupMainPage.png" /></p>
            <p>If you see that then the basic OED install worked and your system is properly serving up the OED web
                system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Though not common, it is possible for the OED web system to run without starting the underlying database
                system. To verify that the database is running properly, you should <a
                    href="{{site.url}}/{{site.helpCurrent}}/optionsMenu/">log into OED</a> as the admin. The username and password were
                shown during the install process. By default they are:<br> email: test@example.com<br> password:
                password<br> Yes, the password really is password but remember it is running on your local machine in a
                container so it should not be accessible to others. If it fails you should see a message appear briefly
                in
                the top, right corner of the page. If this happens, please follow the <a href="#sendConsole">steps
                    below</a>
                to email us the output in your terminal. </li>
            <li>If all went well, you now have a fully running development version of OED that can be used to begin
                coding.
                Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>OED test data</h3>
        <p>When you install OED, it does not have any data. An actual site would connect up meters to gather data. For
            a developer, we have standard test data you can use. The <a href="../testData/">OED test data</a> page has
            information and directions for doing this. We suggest you load up the data now so you can try any features
            you want in OED. Note that an advantage of this test data is that it is the same for all developers so
            people should be able to reproduce what you mention if you have a question or issue.
        </p>

        <h3>Technologies OED uses</h3>
        <p>OED uses a number of technologies. You may want further information on these and some are provided on the <a
                href="../learningTechnologies/">OED technologies page</a>. We welcome your input on other areas you
            would like
            to know about or other resources you find valuable. Note that you can work on parts of OED without knowing
            many of the technologies in any depth. For example, you can work on database queries without knowing about
            the front-end. Thus, many developers begin in areas they know or want to learn first and focus on that
            needed information. Having said that, almost the entire code base is in JavaScript/TypeScript so a basic
            understanding of that is usually needed to get started.</p>

        <h3>OED GitHub Information areas</h3>
        <p>There are two areas on our GitHub repo that are worth noting. First, the <a
                href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/discussions" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion
                board</a>
            has several areas including one for developers. You are encouraged to subscribe to this discussion by
            clicking
            the button on the right side of the page with this discussion group. Second, the <a
                href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/projects?type=beta"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a>
            have an overview of the status of work and major initiatives.</p>
        <h3>Choosing OED work to do</h3>
        <p>The <a href="../work/">What to Work on in OED</a> page can help you figure out what to do.</p>

        <h3>Multi-author work</h3>
        <p>It is common for a team to work on OED together. If you are doing this and want to give another person
            acknowledgement on a commit, then see <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub info on multiple authors</a>. </p>

        <h3>Issues</h3>
        <p id="sendConsole">If you have any issues please copy all the output from your nohup.out (or the terminal
            outside
            Visual Studio Code) and <a href="mailto:developer@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">email</a> it to us. We will look
            it
            over and get back to you. We try to do that quickly. It is also fine to send a message to the developer
            Discord
            channel to seek answers.</p>

        <h3 id="VSCInfo">Useful VSC information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The VSC container you are working in has the Docker extension included. You can access it by clicking
                the
                whale with squares over it icon (<img alt="VSC container msg" src="../images/dockerIcon.png">) on the far
                left
                side of the VSC window (default location). It
                should show information on all the Docker images/containers you have. The containers that are currently
                running have a green triangle next to them. You can get the following choices by right clicking on a
                container:
                <ul>
                    <li>View Logs: The web container (prefixed with “vsc-”) will not show much since the OED output is
                        in
                        nohup.out. The database one will show messages from PostgreSQL. These open a new terminal that
                        you
                        can remove with the trash can icon.</li>
                    <li>Attach Shell: This puts you in a shell within the container that is using the OED environment.
                        It is
                        important to recognize this is not the same as opening a shell on your machine that runs in your
                        local environment. You are strongly encouraged to run all your OED terminal commands in the
                        container so you get the OED environment. For example, it will use the version of node or npm
                        that
                        OED expects.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the shell inside the database you can do: “psql -U oed” to open the Postgres
                                command line. This will allow you to look at the live OED database. You can also see the
                                OED
                                startup files for the database with: ls docker-entrypoint-initdb.d.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>In the shell inside the web container, you can look at the environment variables or do other
                        Linux
                        operation. You can run any script in package.json, e.g., npm run check. You can see all the
                        running
                        processes with “ps -aux”.</li>
                    <li>Inspect: Opens a JSON file that gives detailed information on the container that can be useful
                        for
                        debugging
                        issues.</li>
                    <li>Open in Browser: For the web container, this will go to localhost:3000.</li>
                    <li>Stop, Remove: Stop or remove the container where stop is useful if something does not shut down
                        properly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The VSC container also include several extensions OED thinks are valuable:
                <ul>
                    <li>GitLens: This shows detailed information on Git commits, who made changes, file history and
                        more. It
                        makes working with Git inside VSC much nicer.</li>
                    <li>Code Spell Checker: It will help you avoid spelling mistakes.</li>
                    <li>GitHub Pull Request: It lets you work with GitHub within VSC including creating, commenting on
                        and
                        working with pull requests all with VSC features.</li>
                    <li>Docker was discussed above.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Install OED outside of Visual Studio Code</h3>

        <p>While there is <a href="../devDetails/">further information</a> on more advanced options for doing this, the
            initial install can be done by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal on your computer (it is the "command prompt" on some Windows systems). It is fine to use
                a
                terminal within VSC. In the terminal do the following: <ol>
                    <li><code>cd "directory with cloned OED"</code>. You need to replace "directory with cloned OED"
                        with
                        the location of the cloned copy of OED. This is where the "README.md" and other main OED files
                        are
                        located. Some people find it easiest to locate that directory using the file manager on their OS
                        and
                        then use that information to get to the needed directory. As an example, you might
                        do <code>cd /home/username/projects/OED</code> if you cloned OED in the /home/username/projects/
                        directory. </li>
                    <li><code>docker compose up</code><br>This will run the entire OED install process. Note that on
                        some
                        systems (mostly some Linux systems), depending on how you installed Docker, you may get a
                        permission
                        error so you will need to do:<br><code>sudo docker compose up</code><br>which runs the process
                        with
                        root privileges. If this is the case then you need to do sudo before all docker commands on your
                        system.<br> Depending on the speed of your machine and internet connection, this can take a few
                        to
                        ten minutes. It should go faster after the first install. You will see a lot of output about
                        installing the database (Postgres), getting needed packages (<strong>this can take a while so
                            you
                            may not see output for a while</strong>) and starting up the web system. When you see the
                        line:<br> + 2073 hidden modules<br> where the actual number will likely be different then OED
                        should
                        be running normally unless there was an error in the output. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The developer web pages assume you assess a terminal inside of the Docker container. Normally you can do
                this by going to the Docker icon for your running Docker and selecting the "Dashboard". Then look for
                your
                running OED container in the list. There should be an icon to the right that gives a "CLI". Clicking it
                should get you a command line interface for either the web or database container that OED uses. You can
                do
                other operations to control container through the same interface. You can also do this within VSC with
                the
                Docker extension even though you started OED outside VSC.</li>
            <li>The developer pages often refer to output from OED. This goes to the nohup.out file with Visual Studio
                Code.
                When installed outside of VSC it will come to the terminal where you started OED, even in a terminal
                opened
                in VSC to install OED.</li>
        </ol>
