		<p>Developers want to have test meter data for OED development that is consistent, stable and does not require
			having access to actual meters. This describes how to get and load such meter test data along with related
			groups, units & conversions.</p>

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>What follows assumes you have a properly installed and working OED but have not yet loaded in the reading
			data
			described here. If they have already been loaded then the loading step for that meter will be skipped. At a
			minimum you should be able to see the main OED page in a web browser
			(normally URL of localhost:3000). Normally the database is automatically created and works fine. If you get
			errors about the database then you need to address them before you can do this or get the test data in (if
			you
			get errors during this process).</p>

		<h2>Inserting the standard OED test data</h2>
		<p>The simple and mathematical test data is created in OED by doing the following (they are described later):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure you have OED running so it is available to do the necessary work.
			</li>
			<li>Open a terminal in the web/vsc Docker container by right clicking on the web container in the Docker
				extension of VSC and attaching a shell. (Described in the <a href="../gettingStarted/">getting started
					directions)</a></li>
			<li>In the terminal, run the command <code>npm run testData</code>. This may take a few minutes but when it
				completes there should be new meters with data, new groups, the DB structures are all updated and the
				CSV
				files used
				will be removed unless there was an error. This generates all
				the standard test data except the one where readings are every minute since that is a large dataset that
				is
				less frequently used. See the next step before you
				can use the new OED information within the OED web page.</li>
			<li>As we update OED pages, the code is avoiding reloading Redux state every time. Thus, to see all the
				changes
				in Redux state and to get the array for graphing units, you need to reload an
				existing OED web page. Once done you should see all the test meters/groups and data as described below.
				If
				this
				does not happen then an error likely occurred so carefully look at the output in your terminal that you
				used
				above.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you only want to load some of the data (not the common usage), you can look at package.json for the
			individual
			commands to insert the mathematical data. The others are so small/fast that they are done as above. See
			Mathematical test data section below.</p>

		<h2>Comparison data</h2>
		<p>When you do a compare graph, you choose how far from current time you compare. As a result, you need current
			readings and ones immediately before that time to get data for the comparison graph. If you are using meter
			data
			that does not have this, you will need to create it. Here is how to do it:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get the timezone of your local machine (not the Docker container for OED) by doing this in the terminal:
				<code>date +%Z</code>. For what
				follows the timezone is assumed to be CDT but you should change if your timezone differs.
			</li>
			<li>If you want to be extra careful, check the time in Postgres. Open a Postgres terminal by attaching a
				shell
				to the database container in a similar
				way to how you did it above for the web container. Once inside the database shell, do:
				<code>psql -U oed</code> to access the database terminal and do the following within this
				terminal. Verify timezone is correct by doing:
				<code>select clock_timestamp() at time zone 'CDT';</code>.
				Make sure that it shows the same time as on the clock on your computer that you found in the
				previous step and replace CDT with the timezone using. You can now quit postgres by doing:
				<code>\q</code>
			<li>Open a terminal by attaching a shell
				to the OED web container as was done earlier in this file.</li>
			<li>In the web terminal do:<br>
				<code>node -e 'require("./src/server/util/developer.js").shiftReadings("meter name", "CDT")'</code><br>
				Where "meter name" is replaced with the meter you want to shift and still use the double quotes.
				Similarly,
				CDT should be the timezone found above. The console will show (the shift value will be different):
				<pre>
	shifting meter "meter name" to timezone "CDT"
	The readings were shifted by:  10 days
	refreshing all views since readings changed
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:08.194+00:00] Refreshing All Reading Views...
	
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:08.196+00:00] Refreshing Materialized Daily Reading Views
	
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:08.197+00:00] Refreshing Materialized Hourly Reading Views
	
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:14.231+00:00] Daily View Refreshed
	
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:19.900+00:00] Materialized Hourly View Refreshed
	
	[INFO@2023-10-03T02:05:19.902+00:00] ...Views Refreshed!
			</pre>
			</li>
			<li>If you don't want to refresh the readings (then cannot graph the new data but useful if shifting lots of
				meters until the last one) then add a third parameter of false:<br>
				<code>node -e 'require("./src/server/util/developer.js").shiftReadings("meter name", "CDT", false)'</code>
			</li>
			<li>You need to refresh the web page with OED to see the new compare values of shifted data.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This process can be repeated as often as desired to keep the readings current. If you give an incorrect meter
			name that
			does not exist then an error similar to the following will appear:</p>
		<pre>
	[ERROR@2023-10-02T22:56:40.591+00:00] Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null
	(reading 'humanize')
	Stacktrace:
	TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'humanize')

	(node:288) PromiseRejectionHandledWarning: Promise rejection was handled asynchronously (rejection id: 1)
	(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
		</pre>
		<p>The following figure shows the result after shifting the three amp meters to current time and then doing a
			comparison graphic for 1 week. There is no difference between the meters since they all have the same shape
			and
			only scaling of the readings.</p>

		<h2>Map data</h2>
		<p>The following assumes you have loaded the <a href="../testData/">test data</a> into your development OED
			system.
			You can use other meter data if you prefer.</p>
		<p>Please use the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/adminMapCreating/">admin map creating
				documentation</a> for information on how
			to load and
			calibrate a
			map. This page only describes the necessary details of the test map. You need to be logged in as an admin to
			complete these steps.</p>
		<p>Use the sample <a href="../testData/HappyPlace.png" download>Happy Place map</a> by downloading it. This
			is the map
			you upload into OED. We will call it "Happy Place" and you can use that name in OED or some other name. The
			map
			angle is 0.0 degrees.</p>
		<p>During the calibration step, you will use a mythical GPS coordinate system of (0-30, 0-50) which are real GPS
			values but not usual for a map. This large area works because we will make a perfect calibration with no
			error.
			This means the lower, left corner of the map has GPS coordinate (0, 0) and the top, right has GPS coordinate
			(50, 30). The Plotly grid has values of (0, 0) for lower, left and (300, 500) for the top, right. This means
			the
			coordinates are reversed for GPS (latitude, longitude) compared to the grid (x, y) and are a factor of 10
			smaller. During calibration, click on three places on the map. In principle it does not matter where but
			three
			spread out places on the map is better normally. When you do that, OED will show the grid coordinate you
			clicked on. <strong>As just explained, you need to reverse the coordinates and divide by 10</strong>. Thus,
			if
			you are told "input GPS coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461 in this format ->
			latitude,longitude" then you enter "46.1, 27.7" for the GPS value in the box and submit. Repeat this 3 times
			and
			you should then see an error of 0% for both directions. If not, start over. If yes, then save changes to the
			database. </p>
		<p>The following meters and groups will automatically be placed at these locations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sin Amp 1 kWh at Play Place</li>
			<li>Sin Amp 2 kWh at Swimming Pool</li>
			<li>Sin Amp 1 kWh at Theater</li>
			<li>Sin Amp 1 + 2 kWh (group) at Cafeteria</li>
			<li>Sin Amp 2 + 3 kWh (group) at Housing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If all went well, you should now see the following on the map page.</p>
		<img src="../images/happyPlaceMap.png" alt="what the Happy Place map should look like">

		<h3>Rotated map</h3>
		<p>Sometimes you want to test a rotated map. In this case use <a href="../testData/HappyPlace30Deg.png"
				download>Happy
				Place 30 Deg map</a> that was rotated by 30 degrees. This does not impact the GPS coordinates but means
			the
			simple
			correspondence between the OED grid and GPS no longer holds. During calibration, use these points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bottom, right of Swimming Pool at coordinate 265, 342 with GPS value of 39.5, 27.7</li>
			<li>Bottom, right of Theater at coordinate 217, 234 with GPS value of 23.7, 29.3</li>
			<li>Bottom, right of Cafeteria at coordinate 85, 252, with GPS value of 17.0, 12.7</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This will give: result: x: 3.127%, y: 0.647%. If you switch to this map then you should see the following
			Where items are shown at the same location but the map is rotated.</p>

		<h2>Simple Test Data</h2>

		<h3>Meter data</h3>
		<p>The simple/basic test data is not representative of real meter data nor mathematical but it is easy to use.
			Each
			meter has readings for five days and the line graphs should be a straight line. The following table gives
			the
			expected values for the line graphs for all units for these simple meters where NA indicates that unit is
			not
			allowed/not compatible. The item for each meter/row that is marked with a <sup>*</sup> indicates the default
			graphic unit if one is not already selected. All values are for per hour for the rate. Note kW and kWh are
			not
			impacted by a rate change. The Gallon and Gallon flow are available for testing the rate choices.</p>
		<p>The table also contains the mathematical test data in the lower part.</p>

		<p>For bar graphs, you can easily check the day bars for the simple data. Wider bars will only show for data
			with
			more days as OED does not show bars with days missing at the start or end. The value can be found by taking
			the
			day value on the line graph (shown in the table above) and multiplying by 24. For example, Electric Utility
			kWh
			as kWh has line values of 1-5 and bar values of 24-120. In US Dollars it is 0.115 - 0.575 on line and
			2.76-13.8
			on bar. Tis is because it is 24 times larger as the sum over the 24 hours of the rate/day. This holds for
			both
			quantity and flow units.
		</p>
		<p>If the custom slider is used and the bar width is 2 days then you get two bars: June 2-3 and Jun 4-5. The
			value
			is 120 (48 + 72) and 216 (96 + 120).</p>

		<h2>Mathematical Test Data</h2>
		<p>The OED test data generation code can generate sine and cosine based data. It has several advantages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can create on your own machine without needing to download anything.</li>
			<li>The provided script will generate the data and load it into your OED database for use within the system.
			</li>
			<li>Since it has a regular pattern, it is often easy to see issues in graphed data.</li>
			<li>Different datasets can be used to focus on different types of testing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that the values are shifted so the minimum is 0 since most meter data is like that. It is easy to use
			this
			data by following these steps</p>
		</p>
		<p>The following table gives a list of the available data and information about it. The meter name assumes you
			use
			the provided script to load the data. (If you want to generate the test data outside the usual script, the
			&ltcommand name&gt is what you use to create this dataset manually with
			<code>npm run &ltcommand name&gt</command></code> in a web/vsc Docker container terminal. You will then need
			to
			load the reading data into OED as described on the <a
				href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/adminReadingsImport/">reading
				import page</a>. The file will have the name indicated and is located in the
			<code>src/server/test/db/data/automatedTests/</code> directory. It is important to properly set the reading
			frequency to see the expect result.) The meter name is the one if the testData script is used to create and
			load
			this data.

		<h2>What OED should display with this test data</h2>

		This section gives a range of samples of what OED will display when graphing the test data described above.

		<h3>Simple data</h3>

		<h4>Quantity data</h4>

		<p>The following figure shows the kWh meters and groups as a line graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLinekWh.png" alt="Simple test data line graphic of kWh">

		<p>The following figure shows the kWh meters and groups as a 1 day bar graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimple1dayBarkWh.png" alt="Simple test data 1 day bar graphic of kWh">
		<p>OED will show a blank bar graphic in this case (and all the 5 day meters) for 1 or 4 weeks because it will
			not
			display bars with incomplete meter data at the start or end.</p>

		<p>Same as the line graphic above but in kg of CO<sub>2</sub> to show changing the unit:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLinekWhAskgofCO2.png" alt="Simple test data 1 week bar graphic of kWh">

		<p>Same as above but as a 1 day bar graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimple1dayBarkWhAskgofCO2.png" alt="Simple test data 1 day bar graphic of kWh">

		<p>The following figure shows the water meter as a line graph where the rate is Day to show changing the rate
			and a
			different type of unit. Note KWh must be shown per hour.</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLineGallonWith1hourRate.png"
			alt="Simple test data line graphic of Water in per day">

		<h4>Flow data</h4>

		<p>The following figure shows the kW meters and groups as a line graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLinekW.png" alt="Simple test data line graphic of kW">

		<p>The following figure shows the kW meters and groups as a 1 day bar graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimple1DayBarkW.png" alt="Simple test data 1 day bar graphic of kW" width="90%">

		<p>The following figure shows the water flow meter as a line graph where the rate is Minute to show changing the
			rate
			and a different type of unit. Note kW must be shown per hour.</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLineGallonFlowWith1MinRate.png"
			alt="Simple test data line graphic of Water flow in per hour">

		<h4>Raw data</h4>

		<p>The following figure shows a temperature meter that collects in Fahrenheit but has a default graphic unit of
			Celsius as a line graph:</p>
		<img src="../images/testSimpleLineTempAsCelsius.png"
			alt="Simple test data line graphic of temperature in Fahrenheit as Celsius">

		<h3>Mathematical data</h3>

		<p>The following picture shows the meters Sin 4 Day kWh, Sin 4 Hour kWh, Sin 23 Min kWh, Sin 15 Min kWh. It is
			designed to show how the number of points impact the line quality in OED and verify that varied reading
			rates do
			not impact the OED code. What you see is that the 4 day line is shifted due to the placement of the time
			values.
			The other meters are very similar in value. This shows that the daily averaging in OED is accurate. Note
			that in
			this and all line graphics, you will see the similar values as you zoom in to see hourly or meter level
			points.
			This is because the data is kW. The only change you will see is in the quality of the graphic if you zoom in
			so
			tight that you have limited points to graph.</p>
		<img src="../images/testLineStd.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine with readings at various rates">
		<p>The following picture shows the same meters as above but as a bar graph with 4 week bars. In a perfect world,
			all
			the bars would have the same value for a given date range. As can be seen, there are small differences where
			the
			value varies more as the frequency of the readings goes down. This variation is due to the inaccuracy of low
			frequency readings as is normal.</p>
		<img src="../images/testBarStd.png" alt="Sample bar graphic of sine with readings at various rates">
		<p>The following picture shows a line graphic of the sin values for the 3 different amplitudes (1-3). As
			expected,
			they have the same period with a different amplitude. Plus, it looks nice!</p>
		<img src="../images/testLineAmp.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine with readings at various amplitudes">
		<p>The following picture shows a line graphic of a group containing all the sine amplitudes above but with 1 & 2
			included twice. OED does not duplicate the values so the sum is a maximum of 6 or 1 + 2 + 3.</p>
		<img src="../images/testLineAmpGroupDuplicate.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine group with duplicate">
		<p>The following picture shows a sin and cos with the same amplitude. It should be noted that normally sin and
			cos
			are phase shifted so the high of one is the low of the other. You do not see that because the values were
			shifted to all be positive.</p>
		<img src="../images/testLineSinCos.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine and cosine">
		<p>The following picture shows the meters Sin Sq kWh & Cos Sq kWh along with a group containing both meters (Sin
			Sq
			+ Cos Sq kWh). If OED is working properly then the group should have a constant value since sin^2 + cos^1 =
			1 or
			the value of the amplitude in this case. This is a good test of whether groups work (for simple groups of
			only
			two meters). If you want to see how accurate OED is then just graph this group and you will see that the
			value
			is always very close to 2.5.</p>
		<img src="../images/testLineSquared.png"
			alt="Sample line graphic of sin^2 and cos^2 along with a group combining them.">
		<p>The following image shows sin with readings every minute. It is a very high quality version of the first
			picture
			with points that are less frequent. It is zoomed in to less than a day to show the
			minute points. This data is not automatically generated and is normally only used to test
			OED's speed when there is lots of reading points. You would need to generate this data (placed in
			src/server/test/db/data/automatedTests/oneMinuteFreqTestData.csv) and then upload via CSV as described for
			the
			real-world data.</p>
		<img src="../images/testLine1Min.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine with readings every one minute">

		<h2>Real World Test Data</h2>
		<p>This data can show what happens with actual data. However, it is harder to see when things are off. It is
			provided as an alternative to the mathematical data but will probably be used less now that that data
			exists.
		</p>
		<p>The table below lists the types of test data we have. The first four all have 3.5 years of electric data but
			for
			different meters so the values vary. The last one is a sample file that you can edit to create your own

		<h2>Using the provided data</h2>
		<p>Choose the file you want where clicking on the link in a web browser will download that file. Note you can
			load
			as many test data files as you want into a single OED instance. The import of this data into OED uses the
			CSV
			import feature that is described in the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/adminCsvImport/">CSV
				import documentation</a> and
			pages linked from that page, esp. about readings. You do not need to know all those details but can get
			further
			information as needed.</p>

		<h2>Loading the data into your OED</h2>
		<p>You will want to have OED running during this process. Start it with Docker as you should have previously
			done.
			Log in as an admin user. Go to the CSV upload page using the "CSV" button in the top, right of the OED web
			page.
			You should default to the "Readings" tab which is what you want. Now do the following: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Enter the meter name in the box where the sample graph below used the file name without the extension
				and
				spaces, e.g.,
				"Three Year A" for the first file. You can use any name you like.</li>
			<li>Use the "Choose File" button to select the file with the reading data you are uploading.</li>
			<li>Check the "Create Meter" and "Header row" boxes.</li>
			<li>Check the "Refresh Readings" and "Refresh Hourly Readings" boxes so the readings will be available right
				away for graphing. You can delay doing this until the last upload if you are doing multiple readings
				files
				to make it a little faster. If you forget to do this then you must manually refresh the readings to
				graph
				them.</li>
			<li>Click the "Submit CSV Data" button to start the upload. This will take a little while (probably less
				than
				one minute). A popup window will appear when the upload is done telling you the status. It should be
				SUCCESS
				without any warnings if all went well. If something went wrong then address the issue. Note if there are
				lots of errors then you need to look at the log or console where OED is running to see them all.</li>
			<li>Reload the web page where OED is running to see the new meter(s).</li>
			<li>Go to the meter page and assign the unit and, if desired, the default graphic unit for each meter. The
				examples make them Electric_Utility for the unit and kWh for the default graphic unit. Also set the
				reading
				frequency to 01:00:00 or 1 hour since that is what the data represents.</li>
			<li>You should now be able to graph them.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Below is a line graphic with the four 3.5 year meters. If all went well then this is what you should see.</p>
		<img src="../images/threeYearGraphic.png" alt="Sample line graphic of three year electric test data">
		<p>If you don't see this then something is wrong and you should not continue this process and instead ask us for
			help. (See link at bottom of page)</p>

		<h2>Creating own data</h2>
		<p>You can download the sample data from the table above. You can edit the sampleReadings.csv file by opening it
			in
			you preferred editor where a spreadsheet program is fine as long as you make sure to save it as a CSV file.
			Remove the two sample readings on lines 2 and 3 of the file and create new lines with the data you want.
			Note
			that normally the end time of the previous point is equal to the start time of the next point in real meter
			data. You can put in as many lines as you want with readings. This file has a header row so it
			is easier to see what goes in each column. Once you are done editing and save the file in CSV format, import
			it
			the same way as the provided data above except you need to check the "Header Row" box since the file has a
			header row. Deal with any messages to correct problems and see the <a
				href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/adminReadingsImport/">readings import page</a> for more info on
			dealing with
			issues. Note if there are lots of errors then you need to look at the log or console where OED is running to
			see
			them all.</p>
		<h2 id="dbIssue">Database issue</h2>
		<p>If you cannot load the data into the database or it disappears after shutting down OED, then you likely have
			a
			database issue. To test you can do the following: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Log in as the admin.</li>
			<li>Change the default graph type to something else (say bar) and <strong>save the change</strong>. Make
				sure it
				gives the green popup that it saved okay.</li>
			<li>Refresh the web browser and go tho the main OED page. It should have preselected the bar choice for
				graphic
				indicating that it is the default choice. If this does not work then verify the admin preference change
				was
				actually saved without error because it seems your installation is not saving to the database.</li>
			<li>Shut OED down and bring it back up.</li>
			<li>When OED is done installing, go to the web page and refresh the page. Again, you should see the bar as
				the
				default selection. If this fails then the database changes are not being saved between runs of OED. This
				indicates an install issue. If you don't know what to do then contact us.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Help</h2>
		<p>You should now be done and have the test data in your OED development system. If something did not work then
			you
			can seek help from the project by <a href="mailto:developer@openenergydashboard.org">contacting us</a>.</p>
