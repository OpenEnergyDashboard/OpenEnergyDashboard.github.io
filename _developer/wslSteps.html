            <li>Make sure your WSL is fully installed correctly, following <a
                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" rel="noopener noreferrer">these
                    steps</a>.
                You should <strong>not</strong> use WSL-1.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure Docker is correctly configured to work with WSL, following <a
                    href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/" rel="noopener noreferrer">these steps</a>.</li>
        </ol>
            <p> According to the best practices given in the <a
                    href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/#best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker
                    WSL
                    information</a> (at least when this was written), it is best to work in the Linux container rather
                than
                the Windows file system. This means you should clone OED into the Linux file system and run your code
                environment (such as Visual Studio Code) there as well. The information below assumes you have done this
                and
                the commands given are run in a Linux shell. Specifically, this means: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>You do the
                    <code>git clone &lt;OED GitHub address&gt;</code> in the Linux filesystem. Normally this is done by
                    opening the Linux terminal. You do not want the OED clone on your machine to be on the Windows
                    partition.
                </li>
                <li>To use Visual Studio Code, you will start it from the Linux terminal by doing the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open your Linux terminal. This is commonly the Ubuntu terminal for WSL.</li>
                        <li>Go to the Linux directory with OED in a Linux terminal by doing:
                            <code>cd &lt;path to OED main code directory&gt;</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Start Visual Studio Code by doing: <code>code .</code> (This will start VSC and make the
                            current
                            directory be the code you will work on.) Note the first time you may need to install VSC;
                            This
                            normally happens automatically on Ubuntu. After the first time you can normally click the
                            VSC
                            icon on Windows to start it. It will reopen with the WSL project if that was the last one.
                            If
                            not, you can open the project folder from recent ones or via the command "WSL: Open Folder
                            in
                            WSL...". If you ever have a folder open outside WSL but it is actually on WSL then you can
                            use
                            the command to reopen in WSL (sometimes VSC will suggest you do that).</li>
                        <li>All the other steps should be the same as on the getting started directions.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Errors running <code>docker compose up</code> might throw:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory</code></h3><br> Ensure that docker is
                installed correctly and running - the Docker system tray icon's tooltip should specify that Docker
                Desktop
                is running.
            </li>
            <li> When you first install OED, you get some sort of error message (often about not being able to write the
                pg_wal file). This leads to the database going into a panic stop and the database container exiting.
                When
                this has been seen, the web container continues to run and the npm install continues/completes. Note it
                can
                take a while for the npm install to finish but wait and hopefully this will happen. You will likely then
                get
                a message about trying to start to database but nothing after that one line. At this point, stop the
                install. <ul>
                    <li>If in the VSC container then rebuild the container.</li>
                    <li>If OED was started in a terminal then do a <strong>single ^c</strong> (control and letter c) or
                        <code>docker compose down</code> in a second terminal where it is in the same OED directory as
                        the
                        install is happening. You should now be back at the command line. Do another
                        <code>docker compose up</code> to restart OED.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Normally this will complete the installation fairly quickly without further issues. For now, we
                    encourage
                    you to do these exact steps since deviations have been known to cause it to fail. If have issues
                    then
                    please contact us.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Script errors</h3>
        <p>If you have the OED files stored on the Windows file system, then issues will likely occur. It can happen on
            install, when you run checks (linting) and for other OED scripts. This is because the file format is a
            little
            different. The best solution is to keep all files on the Linux file system (as suggested above). It is
            possible
            to modify the scripts with but this is not the recommended solution.</p>
