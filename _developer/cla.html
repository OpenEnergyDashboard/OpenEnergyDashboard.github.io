		<p>A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is an agreement between an open source project and someone working on
			that
			project. Here are some key points about the OED CLA:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You agree to give the OED project unlimited and free use of any work you submit. This guarantees that
				OED
				will remain free and someone cannot later decide to revoke permission which can cause serious issues for
				the
				project.</li>
			<li>You retain the copyright and are allowed to use your work in any way you wish.</li>
			<li>You are giving us your work "as-is". You are not under any obligation to give support for what you
				provide.
			</li>
			<li>Your agreeing to the CLA is under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL). The OED project
				guarantees
				that all its work will remain under the MPL so you are assured that your contributions will always be
				free
				and open source under the MPL terms.</li>
			<li>The wording of this CLA is consistent and similar to other CLA agreements and not something unique to
				the
				OED project.</li>
		</ul>

				target="_blank">OED CLA</a> to review what it says and agree to its terms before you make a contribution
			to
			the project. Thanks! </p>
