		<p>In preparing for an OED release, the following steps should be followed:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Releases should correspond to a Milestone for the project.</li>
			<li>Announce to the Discord developer channel so everyone can look over the proposed release.</li>
			<li>Review the Milestone for this release to make sure all issues are complete or reassigned.</li>
			<li>See if there are any package or security issues that need to be addressed.</li>
			<li>Prepare the documentation pages for new release in the OpenEnergyDashboard.github.io repo. These
				steps assume you
				have forked this repo onto your own account and are working from that fork (probably in a local
				clone):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Make sure all changes are done for the previous release and put in the OED repo for the main
					branch.
				</li>
				<li>Update your clone from the the main branch in OED repo. You can do this on your GitHub website
					or git
					fetch and merge of the main branch of the OED repo (generally referred to as upstream as where
					the fork
					came from) into your local main in Visual Studio. If you do it on the GitHub website then you
					will need
					to pull it down into your local clone.</li>
				<li>Create a new branch from the one you just updated for the new release. For example, if going
					from
					version 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 then branch main to create the branch v0.7.0. Commit these changes and
					the push
					them out to your fork (will probably require you to accept publishing the new branch if in
					Visual Studio
					and do it to your origin/forked copy).</li>
				<li>To allow testing of the new branch on your fork, go to the OpenEnergyDashboard.github.io repo on
					your
					GitHub account in a web browser. Click on the "Settings" tab and then click on the "Pages"
					choice on the
					left side of the page. Under "Source", use the "Branch" dropdown menu to choose the new branch
					that you
					just pushed/published. This should cause you to see this branch when you go to https://&lt;your
					GitHub
					ID&gt;.github.io/OpenEnergyDashboard.github.io where you replace <your GitHub ID> with your id.
				</li>
				<li>Duplicate the previous release's documentation directory into the new release directory. For
					example, copy
					help/v0.6.0 to help/v0.7.0.</li>
				<li>Unfortunately, you need to manually update the links to go from the previous release to the new
					release.
					In the new documentation directory (e.g., help/v0.7.0) edit each change listed below to update
					the version (e.g.,
					v0.6.0 to v0.7.0) so do the following:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Globally change the documentation links, e.g. help/v0.6.0 to help/v0.7.0. You can do this in
						the global
						search box in Visual Studio. Note it is important to prefix it with help/ so you don't edit
						other
						references to the version.</li>
					<li>edit _layouts/admin.html to add a line above<br>
						&lt;a href="../v0.6.0/{% raw %}{{page.name}}{% endraw %}"&gt;OED version 0.6.0
						Help&lt;/a&gt;<br>
						so it now has the line<br>
						&lt;a href="../v0.7.0/{% raw %}{{page.name}}{% endraw %}"&gt;OED version 0.7.0
						Help&lt;/a&gt;<br>
					</li>
					<li>Similarly, edit _layouts/help.html, to add a line above<br>
						&lt;a href="../v0.6.0/{% raw %}{{page.name}}{% endraw %}"&gt;OED version 0.6.0
						Help&lt;/a&gt;<br>
						so it now has the line<br>
						&lt;a href="../v0.7.0/{% raw %}{{page.name}}{% endraw %}"&gt;OED version 0.7.0
						Help&lt;/a&gt;<br>
					</li>
					<li>Edit help/v0.7.0/_version.html to update the version shown, e.g., 0.6.0 to 0.7.0.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Update the help pages to reflect the new release. Be careful to do new screenshots if the look
					of OED
					has changed.</li>
				<li>Commit the changes.</li>
				<li>Push the changes to your fork.</li>
				<li>Check the changes work on your GitHub account (see above). When all is okay, create a pull
					request to
					put these changes into the OED GitHub pages. After it is merged, verify all still works okay.
				</li>
				<li>Note that if you find an issue with documentation included in previous releases then you will
					need to
					manually edit earlier versions to include this change, as appropriate.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Do the final steps to prepare for the new version:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit package.json to change the line ""version": "0.6.0"," to the version number you are about
					to
					release. Assuming you are going to version 0.7.0 (as in the next step for migrations) then it
					becomes:
					"version": "0.7.0",. You also need to edit package-lock.json to make a similar change as
					migrations do
					not update this file given changes in package.json.</li>
				<li>Assuming you have a migration of the database for this release, edit
					``src/server/migrations/registerMigration.js`` to add a line that corresponds to the migration
					folder in
					``src/server/migrations``. For example, if you are migrating from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 and have the
					directory
					``src/server/migrations/0.6.0-0.7.0`` then you add the line ``require('./0.6.0-0.7.0')``
					remembering
					to put a
					comma at the end of line on the next-to-last (penultimate) line with a require." You should put
					the
					migration listings in order of their release number. Note if the last release did not have
					migrations
					then you need to use that as the previous version number so that the migration directories (and
					the next
					step) do not have gaps in the ranges or the migration will fail.
				</li>
				<li>Create the index.js file in the migration you are adding, e.g.,
					``src/server/migrations/0.6.0-0.7.0/sql/index.js``. You can look at one for a previous migration
					to
					see what
					to do. First, you need to edit the lines so the "fromVersion" and "toVersion" correspond to the
					version
					you are going from to the version you are going to. In the running example that would be
					"fromVersion:
					'0.6.0'," and "toVersion: '0.7.0',". You now need to add a line inside "up: async db => {" for
					each
					migration file you have in this migration subdirectory. An example of a line would be:<br>await
					db.none(sqlFile('../migrations/0.6.0-0.7.0/sql/meter/some_meter_change.sql'));
					<br>where you need to make sure there is one line for each file that actually exists for this
					migration.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Do extensive running and testing of OED in a web browser. When possible, test in all major web
				browsers.
			</li>
			<li>Verify the upgrade from a previous version works using the directions on the latest version of the
				<a href="{{site.url}}/{{site.helpCurrent}}/adminUpgrading/">Admin
					Upgrading</a> help page. This normally means starting from the previous version on a server. If
				not
				already
				there see the <a href="{{site.url}}/{{site.helpCurrent}}/adminInstallation/">Admin Installation</a>
				help page on
				doing this
				where you will need to load in test data, add
				groups, etc. before upgrading to be sure the database migrates correctly. From the previous version
				you do
				the upgrade. After the upgrade make sure everything works correctly including the new features.
			</li>
			<li>Create the GitHub release following the steps in <a
					href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub
					Managing releases in a repository</a>. Note you can save as a draft for later release.</li>
			<li>Add info about release to an OED news items and release pages on the website.</li>
			<li>Celebrate.</li>
