        <p>The OED code base is organized into directories. Understanding the structure of this layout can help in
            working
            on the code.</p>

        <p>The project is organized into a number of subdirectories. The primary division is among:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Metadata, configs, and deployment information</li>
            <li>Frontend code</li>
            <li>Backend code</li>
            <li>Common code</li>
            <li>Other directories</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Metadata</h2>
        <p>In the root directory, OED has several metadata files. These are further organized by technology or purpose.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Frontend Code</h2>
        <p>All frontend code is stored in <code>src/client/app/</code>. This is the code that actually runs in the
            user's
            web browser. See the <a href="./technologies.html">technologies</a> page for a diagram showing how this code
            is
            transpiled and minified prior to delivery.</p>
        <p>This code is contained in several directories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>actions/</strong> are the messages that components send to reducers to change the application
                state. </li>
            <li> <strong>components/</strong> are the React.js components which generate HTML that is displayed on the
                page.
                Components can be combined and composed to create the UI that is displayed to the user. </li>
            <li> <strong>containers/</strong> connect the React.js components to the application state (managed by
                Redux)
                through props and dispatched actions. </li>
            <li> <strong>reducers/</strong> accept messages sent by components and change the global application state
                accordingly. </li>
            <li> <strong>style/</strong> CSS files for the website. </li>
            <li> <strong>translations/</strong> defines the strings used to make OED multilingual. </li>
            <li> <strong>types/</strong> define the datatypes used throughout the frontend. </li>
            <li> <strong>utils/</strong> defines functions used across the application and some APIs. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Backend Code</h2>
        <p>All backend code is stored in <code>src/server/</code>, except for the executable server, which is
            <code>src/bin/www/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Beneath that, there are several folders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>data/</strong> functions to generate test data (not used directly by the application but for
                testing). </li>
            <li> <strong>middleware/</strong> middleware for dealing with web requests. </li>
            <li> <strong>migrations/</strong> contains SQL files that are used to upgrade between database versions.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>models/</strong> contains classes which connect JavaScript code to the database so that routes
                can
                actually interact with data. </li>
            <li> <strong>routes/</strong> contains functions defining the actual URLs that the server provides, which is
                how
                the frontend interacts with the server. </li>
            <li> <strong>services/</strong> contains scripts used by developers and administrators to modify the data in
                ways that are inaccessible through the web interface. </li>
            <li> <strong>sql/</strong> contains the database queries used by models to talk to the PostgreSQL database.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>test/</strong> contains the test code run for validation of OED. </li>
            <li> <strong>utils/</strong> contains utility functions and constants. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Code</h2>
        <p>All common code is stored in <code>src/common/</code>. This code defines data types which are in shared use
            between the client and the server.</p>

        <h2>Scripts</h2>
        <p>Scripts are stored in <code>src/scripts/</code>.</p>
        <p>The scripts are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>checkHeader.sh</strong> verifies that all source files have the MPLv2 legal header. It is run
                in
                CI. </li>
            <li> <strong>checkMeters.sh</strong> verifies if a file of IP addresses has meters that respond. Used for
                testing meters or before input of meters into OED. Mostly targets MAMAC meters that are web based. </li>
            <li> <strong>checkTypescript.sh</strong> verifies that there are no untyped JavaScript files in the client
                tree.
                It is run in CI. </li>
            <li> <strong>devcheck.sh</strong> runs all the checks (header, typescript, types and lint) in one easy step.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>devstart.sh</strong> starts both the webserver and Webpack, in dev mode (watches files and
                shows
                interactive). This isn not normally used to start OED for developers. </li>
            <li> <strong>installOED.sh</strong> sets up OED, either for development or production, creating the database
                schema and installing dependencies. This is often run using <code>docker compose up</code> or some
                variant
                of this. It should be automatically run inside toe VSC container. </li>
            <li> <strong>oed.service</strong> is a sample <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/"
                    rel="nofollow">systemd</a> unit file which allows Linux system administrators to start OED on
                startup.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>refreshReadingViewsCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
                instance, with cron) which updates the daily view table that is needed to graph OED data. </li>
            <li> <strong>refreshDailyReadingViewsCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals
                (for
                instance, with cron) which updates the hourly view table that is needed to graph OED data. </li>
            <li> <strong>sendLogEmailCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for instance,
                with
                cron) which sends an email with information from OED logging since the last time this ran. </li>
            <li> <strong>updateEgaugeMetersOEDCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
                instance, with cron) which updates eGauge-brand meters. </li>
            <li> <strong>updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash</strong> is a script meant to be run at regular intervals (for
                instance, with cron) which updates Mamac-brand pull-type meters. </li>
            <li> <strong>updateOED.sh</strong> To be run after pulling the latest version from Git. Grabs new
                dependencies
                and migrates the database. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other directories</h2>
        <p>One will see other directories in the OED code base after install and work with OED. These are not normally
            changed by someone. A few noticeable ones are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>node_modules/</strong> is created during the npm install process and contains information on all
                node packages used.</li>
            <li><strong>postgres-data/</strong> is created during the PostgreSQL install process and contains the
                information about the database and all records stored. It is the one set of files that exist between
                runs of
                the Docker container and are linked from the Docker container to the regular file system. This is done
                so
                that the database settings and records exist between runs.</li>
        </ul>
