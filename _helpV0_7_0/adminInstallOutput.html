        <p>When you install OED for production you will get output similar to what is below (assuming this is the first
            time
            you are running <code>docker compose up</code>). Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This output was created on 13 Oct 2021 on RHEL 7 system using OED v0.6.0. The exact output will vary
                with
                machine type and changes to
                OED.</li>
            <li>There are often colors in the output but that is not shown.</li>
            <li>Items with // at the start were added after the fact to give information at the point it will occur in
                the oupt.</li>
            <li>The warning:<br>
                WARNING: could not open statistics file "pg_stat_tmp/global.stat": Operation not permitted<br>
                may or may not show up. It also shows up at other times. The complete answer is not known but it appears
                to
                be a transient error in PostgreSQL writing log information. It has never caused any problems. On rarer
                occasions it involves another PostgreSQL file.</li>
        </ul>
