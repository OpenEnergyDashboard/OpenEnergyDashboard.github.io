        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>This page describes the process of importing meters into OED via a CSV file. See the <a
                href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page for an overview and information common to all CSV
            imports.</p>

        <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>The information needed to upload meters is the same whether done via the web page or direct file upload. The
            web
            page looks as follows:</p>
        <img alt="admin CSV meter page" src="../images/OEDAdminMeterCSV.png">
        <p></p>

        <h3>Required and optional information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The user name and password is required in the direct file upload as described on the <a
                    href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page. It is automatically provided on the web page
                upload since you are logged in.</li>
            <li><i>CSV file ("Choose File" button on web page; <code>csvFile</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>:
                This gives the location of the CSV file containing the meter information. On the web page it is via a
                file
                picker popup. See below on the file format.</li>
            <li><i>Is CSV file in gzip format ("Gzip" checked if true on web page; <code>gzip</code> parameter on direct
                    file upload)</i>: Note this is the Gnu zip format and not a standard .zip file format. The default
                value
                is true. Note that gzip files are smaller in size for upload and also have internal validation to
                protect
                against corruption so they are preferred.</li>
            <li><i>Does CSV have a header row ("Header Row" checked if true on web page; <code>headerRow</code>
                    parameter on
                    direct file upload)</i>: Is the first row of the CSV file header information and not an actual meter
                (see below for format). The default value is false.</li>
            <li><i>Is this an update ("Update" checked if true on web page; <code>update</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>: Each row is new information for the meter so it will be update with any provided values
                and
                others are left as currently set. The default value is false.</li>
            <li><i>Meter name ("Meter name" input box on web page; <code>meterName</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>: This is only used if you want to change the name of a meter (not identifier). The meter
                name provided is used as the name to update and the meter name value in the CSV is used as the new name.
                Note you can only update a single meter name at a time meaning that the CSV can only have one row of
                meter
                information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meter CSV file format</h3>
        <p>If the file has a header row then it should be:<br>
            name,ipaddress,enabled,displayable,type,timezone,gps,identifier,note,area,cumulative,reset,reset start,reset
            end,gap,variation,duplicates,timesort,end only,reading,start time,end time<br>
            More information on the first set of columns/values are described on the <a
                href="../adminMeterViewing/">admin
                meter viewing</a>
            page and the later ones are the meter defaults for reading input and described on the <a
                href="../adminReadingsImport/">admin reading import</a> page.<br>
            Each following line should contain the values for one meter. Most values can be skipped where the default
            value
            for OED will be used. A brief description of each value is in the following table:

        <h3>Sample file</h3>
        <p>Below are the lines for a CSV meter import file with a header row. It will import two meters (Meter 1 and
            Meter
            2) where the meters are not enabled but are displayable. Please note that "1.2, -3.4" is a pair of values
            separated by a comma that would be in a single column of the CSV file and input without the quotes, i.e.,
            1.2,
            -3.4. The quotes are added when such a CSV is saved to make it clear that the comma is not a new column.
            Most
            values that are optional and unspecified so the
            default values are used. This <a href="../files/meters.csv" download>meters.csv</a> was loaded
            using the curl command of:<br>
            <code>curl https://myoedserver.come:3000/api/csv/meters -X POST -F 'headerRow=true' -F 'gzip=false' -F 'email=csvuser@myorg.com' -F 'password=csvuserpassword' -F 'csvfile=@meters.csv'</code><br>
            assuming the shown URL, user email and password. (See <a href="../adminReadingsImport/#sampleFiles">admin
                reading sample files</a> for more information on URL, email and password.) You need to reload the OED
            web
            page so your browser is aware of the new meters but you will get an empty graphic if used since they don't
            have
            any data.

        <h3>Return messages</h3>
        <p>What follows are the common messages returned from a meter upload along with their meaning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe41
            seems to exist when inserting new meters and got DB error of: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
            "meters_name_key"</code><br>
                This normally happens when the name (or similarly identifier) of the meter already exists. It may be the
                case that you wanted to update this meter but did not specify this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe42
            does not seem to exist with update for meters and got DB error of: No data returned from the query.</code><br>
                Request indicated to update meter(s) but at least one did not exist. All meters must exist on update.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h1&gt;Successfully inserted the meters.&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to
            upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name provided (pipe40) in request with update for meters but
            more than one meter in CSV so not processing</code><br>
                When you want to change a meter name you specify the name in the request as well as the CSV file. It
                then
                uses the name in the request to find the meter and the value in the CSV as the new meter name. However,
                you
                can only have a single meter in the CSV file for this to work. This indicates more than one meter was
                provided.
            </li>
            <li>You can get a variety of error messages if the gzip is improperly set. These include "TypeError",
                "invalid
                message format" and others. This is because OED is incorrectly reading the CSV file and receives garbled
                information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
        <p id=newMeter>Note that for efficiency reasons and because it is uncommon for the meters to change, OED does
            not automatically
            recheck for new meters when doing graphing. If you add new meters, there are two ways to get them to be
            available for graphing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can visit the <a href="../adminMeterViewing/">Meters viewing page</a> if logged in as an admin.
                This
                page works directly with meter information and
                it does recheck for updates. Once this is done, any new meters will also be available for graphing. This
                is
                the fastest/easiest way to do this.</li>
            <li>You can refresh the web browser page with OED. This will cause it to return to the initial state with
                updated information. However, you will lose all unsaved changes along with any selected meters/graphics
                meaning you are restarting from scratch. This is probably only desireable if someone who is not an admin
                needs to see the meter changes right away.</li>
        </ol>
