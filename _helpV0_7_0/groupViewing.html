		<p>Groups aggregate data as explained on the <a href="../graphingGroups/">group graphing</a> help page. To

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

		<p>"Group 1 & 2" is highlighted which means its contents are being shown. The "Child Meters:" box has "Meter 1"
			and
			"Meter 2" which indicates this group includes those two meters. The "Child Groups:" box is empty indicating
			that
			no groups are included. Overall, this means graphing "Group 1 & 2" would show the sum of "Meter 1" and
			"Meter 2".

		<p>If you click on "Group 1 & 2 & 7 & 8" in the "View Groups" box (becomes highlighted in blue) then you will
