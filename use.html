		The OED project will be forever free and anyone is welcome to use it.
		We encourage
		you to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
			us</a> if you are using OED so we can let you know about significant developments and to help you get the
		most out of OED. Sites install the OED system either on an owned server or in the cloud. The project has <a
			href="help/v1.0.0/adminInstallation.html">installation directions</a> and <a
			href="help/v1.0.0/admin.html">help on administering OED</a>. Feel free
		to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
			us</a> for help in doing this.</p>
