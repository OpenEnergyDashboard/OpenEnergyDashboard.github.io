        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>The canonical format for OED to acquire information is the vendor neutral CSV (Comma Separated Values)
            format. It
            is used for both importing meter and reading information. This is the same format used for <a
                href="../export/">reading export</a> so exported data can also be imported into OED. The mechanism is
            the
            same for both meters and readings but the details vary given the information being imported is different.
            This
            section has information that is shared by both imports along with links to pages with details on each type
            of
            import.</p>

        <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
        <h3>Ways to import CSV data</h3>
        <p>OED supports the import of CSV files via a web page and via direct file upload (normally done via a script).
            The
            information needed and the CSV file uploaded are the same but the details of two mechanisms vary. Each
            mechanism
            is described in the next two sections.</p>

        <h4>CSV file upload via the web page</h4>
        <p>If you click on the "CSV" button in the top, right of the main OED screen you will go to the CSV page shown
            below. Note that a user must have CSV privileges to see the "CSV" button. This is an OED user with overall
            "admin" rights or just "csv" rights. See the <a href="../adminUser/">admin user page</a> for more
            information on
            users.</p>
        <img alt="admin CSV page" src="../images/OEDAdminCSV.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
        <p>There are now two tabs near the top of the page (highlighted in blue boxes): one for "Readings" and one for
            "Meters"
            where each imports the a CSV file with the expected import information. The initially selected tab is
            normally
            the "Readings" one. This page allows for setting options and selecting the desired CSV file and are
            described
            on the upload help page for each type of upload (see later for appropriate links).</p>

        <h4>CSV file upload via direct file upload</h4>
        <p>Direct file upload is accomplished via HTTP POST request that is often done using the curl command via a
            script. A sample line to upload a meter is:</p>
        <code>curl https://myuniv.edu:3000/api/csv/meters -X POST -F 'email=csvadmin@myuniv.edu' -F 'password=something' -F 'csvfile=@meterinfo.csv.gz'</code>
        <p>where the command can be understood as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>curl</code>: The command to mimic an HTTP request.</li>
            <li><code>https://myuniv.edu:3000/api/csv/meters</code>: https://myuniv.edu would be replaced with the URL
                of
                where your OED
                site is located. This specifies where the HTTP request is sent and how it is routed within the OED
                application (in this case to the api for csv for meters). OED encourages you to use https (assuming you
                site
                is set up to accept secure connections) so the transmission of user and password is secure. You can use
                http: if that is necessary for your site. Note you would replace "meters" with "readings" if
                you were sending a reading CSV.</li>
            <li><code>-X POST</code>: Indicates the type of HTTP request being made. This is required and always the
                same.
            </li>
            <li><code>-F 'email=csvadmin@myuniv.edu'</code>: All values are sent by placing them after "-F". They are a
                key/value pair separated by an equal (=) sign. The value on the left of the equal sign is the key that
                is
                known as the parameter. The value on the right of the equal sign is the value for this parameter. For
                this
                key/value, the email address ("email" parameter) of an admin with CSV rights is being supplied with the
                value "csvadmin@myuniv.edu". The next key/value pair is for the "password" (parameter) and "something"
                (assumed password for the OED user csvadmin@myuniv.edu). These two parameters must always be provided so
                OED
                knows that only appropriate people are submitting requests. Note that if the user email is not in the
                OED
                system then OED will return the message:<br>
                <pre><code>
        &lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;QueryResultError {
            code: queryResultErrorCode.noData
            message: "No data returned from the query."
            received: 0
            query: "SELECT id, email, password_hash, role FROM users WHERE email='csvuser@myorg.com';"
        }
        </code></pre> where csvuser@myorg.com would be the email you actually provided. If the user password is
                incorrect
                then OED will return the message:<br>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;Error: Invalid credentials</code>
            </li>
            <li><code>-F 'csvfile=@meterinfo.csv.gz'</code>: This supplies the name of the CSV file with the information
                for
                uploading. The parameter name is "csvfile" and the value is "@meterinfo.csv.gz". Note the file
                information
                must be preceded with an @ sign. In this example the file is in the same directory as where the curl
                command runs. If there was a path to the file then it would precede the file name using the format for
                the
                OS for the computer running the curl command. For example, if it was in the "csv" folder under the
                directory
                where the curl was run then on a Linux system you would use "-F 'csvfile=@csv/meterinfo.csv.gz'". Note
                that
                in this case the CSV file is gzipped so it has a .csv.gz file extension. Note the csvfile parameter must
                be
                the last one given on direct file upload.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many more parameters that can be used and they are described on the pages for readings and meters
            upload (see links below). Note that to upload readings you use
            <code>curl myuniv.edu:3000/api/csv/readings -X POST -F 'email=csvadmin@myuniv.edu' -F 'password=something' -F 'csvfile=@meterinfo.csv.gz'</code>
            where many more parameters are allowed.
        </p>
        <p>The web page upload does certain checks and restricts input of values for the parameters. The curl command
            uses
            the values provided. Thus, it is possible to get problematic values farther into the OED upload process when
            you
            use curl. This isn't a bug in OED but noted so you are aware.</p>

        <h3>Returned information</h3>
        <p>Whenever a CSV upload is requested, OED returns information about the request. This information is in HTML
            format
            because it can contain a lot of information. You may find it easiest to copy the returned information into a
            file with the extension ".html" and then open that file in a web browser so it is nicely formatted. In the
            case
            of the web page, the returned information is shown as a popup window on the CSV web page. You need to click
            "OK"
            to close the window even if there are no issues. This is done to be sure you can easily see and copy
            anything
            returned. Some web browsers limit the number of lines you see so there will be something like "..." at the
            end.
            In this case you need to look at the log to see them all. In the case of direct file upload, the information
            is
            returned to the command that sent the request.
            This generally means it comes back to the script/command you used. OED also returns a valid HTTP code where
            it
            sends code 200 if all data was processed and stored and code 500 if any data was not accepted. If all data
            was
            accepted then the returned message will begin with "&lt;h1&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h1&gt;" and if there was an
            issue it
            will begin with "&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;h1&gt;". These are generally followed by
            additional information. Note OED can return a different error code and message under unusual errors but the
            code
            is
            always something different from 200.</p>

        <h3>Getting the process working</h3>
        <p>It may be easiest to test CSV upload via the web page and/or issuing a single direct file upload with limited
            data outside a script to
            be sure everything is set up properly. Once any issues are resolved, an automated or script-based process
            should
            normally work well. You can create a dummy meter for this process and then set it not to be displayed. Note
            it
            is important that any automated system detect the errors OED returns so they are properly dealt with.
            Otherwise,
            errors may go unnoticed and cause other issues.</p>

        <h3>Meters and readings specific information</h3>
        <p>Information specific to meters is on the <a href="../adminMetersImport/">meters import page</a> and
            information
