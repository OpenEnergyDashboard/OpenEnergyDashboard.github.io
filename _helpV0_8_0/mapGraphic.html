		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The map graphic gives a spacial representation of energy usage. Typically a simplified map of buildings and
			any
			important landmarks is used as the image for a map. A circle is placed on the map for each graphed item
			where
			the size of the circle represents its usage. An OED site can have as many maps as it wishes. To get this
			graphic, you click the "Map" choice (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure). This is a simple map
			with
			a few buildings
			where the usage is given for "Play Place" (Meter 7), "Theater" (Meter 8) and "Cafeteria" (Group 1 & 2). Note
			that there are hover items as with other graphics and this figure shows the time range, what the circle
			represents (Groups 1 & 2) and its value. (The top values are the coordinates the graphics package uses and
			are
			not likely of interest.) As the
			size of the circles show, the "Cafeteria" used
			significantly more energy than the other two.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>When you go to the map page, you can select the map you want to use. You do this by clicking the
			dropdown menu for "Maps:" and clicking the one you want (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure).
			This
			is very similar to what you do for a "Meter:" or "Group:". Note that if there is only one map then OED will
			automatically select it so the select in this case would not really be needed. Once you click on a map, it
			will
			appear in the graphic. If you already have meters
			selected that can be shown on the map then they will immediately appear. (See below for more on selecting
			meters.)</p>
		<img alt="selecting map" src="../images/OEDMapSelection.png">
		<p>You select the <a href="../graphingMeters/">meters</a> or <a href="../graphingGroups/">groups</a> to graph
			in the usual way. OED will display
			each meter as an individual circle as shown in the figure above. In some cases the meter/group cannot be
			placed on the
			graph. This happens when its GPS coordinates do not lie within the map. Note that a meter/group without GPS
			coordinates provided by the admin of the site can never be placed on any map. To let the user know when a
			meter/group
			cannot be placed on the current map, its name is grayed out. These meters/groups cannot be selected. In the
			following
			figure, Meters 2, A and B are
			grayed out (highlighted with blue boxes) since they cannot be shown on the map. Meters 7 and 8 look normal
			since
			they can be shown on the map and selected.</p>
		<img alt="grayed out meters that cannot be shown on map" src="../images/OEDMapGrayedMeters.png">
		<p>If you selected Meter 7 and Meter 8 and Group 1 & 2 then you would see the graphic at the top of this page.
		</p>

		<p>The circle represents the average daily usage over the time range chosen in the "Map Interval:". The allowed
			time
			ranges are "Day", "Week" and "4 Weeks" and highlighted in blue in the next figure. In this figure, the "Day"
			choice was selected and note that the circle sizes differ from the first figure since the relative usage is
			different for one day than 4 weeks. These time ranges are the same selections
			as on a bar graph. A selection on either
			the bar or map page impacts the other graphic. Note that there is no slider on the map page (this may change
			in
			the future) and changes to the slider on the bar graphic page does not change the time range on the map
			graphic.
			The
			value shown on the map is the same as on the last bar shown in the bar graphic except divided by the number
			of
			days for the time range. As with bar graphics, the overall dates graphed are the same as the selection in
			the
			line graphic. This means if you change the date range on the line graphic, the bar graphic changes to those
			dates and the
			map graphic also changes the circle size.</p>

		<p>If a site has multiple maps that lie in different geographical locations, then a meter grayed out on one map
			might be displayable on another. Also, if you are on a different graphic type and are displaying a meter
			that
			cannot be shown on the map then it will not appear on the map and be grayed out on the "Meters:" list. If
			you
			return to another graphic, the meter will appear again since it can be shown.</p>

		<h3>Map circle colors</h3>
		<p>OED consistently uses the same color for a meter/group across all graphic representations. The map graph may
			seem
			to have a lighter shade of color than the other graphics. This is due to making the circle partly
			transparent so
			you can see the underlying map image. If you look at the color the rectangle that pops up when you hover on
			the
			graph you will see it is the same as the color used for this item in other graphics.</p>

		<h3>Map circle size</h3>
		<p>The size of a circle is based on its area (not the diameter) so the circle area scales with usage. This was
			chosen since
			a study indicated that area is the better choice for user perception.</p>
		<p>OED makes the circle size be from an internally set minimum and maximum size so that it ranges within a set
			percentage of the map size. Note this has a couple of important implications:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The size of circles can change as you select new items to place on the map. This only happens if a new
				item
				has greater usage than any previously chosen item. This occurs because OED makes the item with the
				highest
				usage have the maximum size allowed and scales all the other items appropriately. This allows circles to
				be
				as large as possible.</li>
			<li>The minimum size of the circle means that items with low usage do not become so small that they cannot
				be
				seen. However, it does mean that items with small circles will not accurately represent the actual
				usage.
				Hovering over a circle will cause a popup that displays the actual usage.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Format of dates and times</h3>
		<p>See <a href="../lineGraphic/#datetimeFormat">explanation in line graphics</a> for why data and time format
			varies with displayed language.</p>
