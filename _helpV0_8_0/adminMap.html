		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>See the <a href="../mapGraphic/">map graphic page</a> for general information on OED and maps. Note that
			unlike
			many systems, using maps in OED does not require any additional software nor the use of GIS. Instead,
			you load a
			graphical image you want to use as a map. This can be anything from a real map, a stylized graphic with
			buildings and features of interest to an arbitrary graphic. Once loaded, you calibrate this map by
			informing OED
			about a few GPS coordinates for items on the map. OED will automatically allow users to place meters on
			a graph
			as long as you have <a href="../adminMeterViewing/">input the GPS data for that meter</a>. OED allows
			sites to
			have
			as many maps as they wish and maps can overlap. For example, you could have maps with two different
			sites and a
			map that zooms in to show details of one of the sites.</p>
		<p>This greatly simplified
			system is based on a simple assumption that the map is flat. In actuality, the world is a sphere so that
			it is
			curved. However, over modest distances, it is effectively flat. This is why local maps don't appear
			warped but
			ones of the entire global make some areas look much larger than they really are. Since most maps
			involving a
			site are over very modest distances this works very well. If you want a large geographical area map then
			see <a href="#circlePlacementIssues">circle placement below</a> on making this work. Note that you can
			have
			different maps that are very
			far apart without any issue. It is only a single map covering a large area that causes issues.</p>
		<p>For this system to work, OED needs to know the rotation of each map from true north. This allows OED to
			align the
			real world longitude and latitude (used in GPS) with the map graphic. OED internally stores this
			rotation as the
			angle from true north on the map graphic to straight up on the map graphic going in the counterclockwise
			direction. OED can then use this angle to properly calibrate the map and place items on the map (see
			below).
			While this is fully functional within OED, there is not yet an admin interface to set the rotation
			angle. We
			plan to soon add the needed interface so the admin can set the rotation angle for each map. When
			that is done, this help page will be enhanced to explain how to get the rotation angle and place it in
			OED for a
			given map. Until that time you should contact OED for help in dealing with rotated maps.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>If you click on the "Maps" button in the top, right of the main OED screen you will go to the maps page
			shown
			below. This shows the page when no maps are on the site. Click the blue "Create a Map" button to begin
			the
			process of uploading a map.</p>
		<img alt="admin map page without maps" src="../images/OEDAdminMapViewingEmpty.png">
		<p>You should now be on the page shown below. Click on the "Browse ..." button (highlighted with a blue box)
			to open
			a standard web browser pop up to select a file. Choose the graphical image of your map. Note the image
			can be of
			types JPEG or PNG (the file extension does not matter but the contents must be one of these two image
			types).
			OED will allow you to choose other types of files and tell you the upload is complete but you
			will find the file image does not appear on the next step. There are many programs/apps that will allow
			you to
			convert to one of these two types of graphical images. Once you have uploaded the map image, use the box
			immediately below (labeled "Define a name for the map:") to name your map. Note this is the name that a
			user
			will see (it can be edited later). In this example, "Happy Place" was used. Finally, you need to input
			the angle
			of the map relative to true north. To properly display maps, OED needs to know the vector that points to
			true
			north on the uploaded map. This is the clockwise angle between straight up on the map image you upload
			and true
			north. See the discussion on <a href="#angle">true north angle</a> below for setting this value on a
			rotated
			map. When
			you are ready, click the "Save and continue" button to complete this step.</p>
		<img alt="admin map loading page" src="../images/OEDAdminLoadMap.png">
		<p>You should then see the confirmation popup shown below. The exact look differs depending on your web
			browser. It
			may or may not show the URL and it will definitely differ from localhost:3000 (special URL for
			development).
			Click "OK" to continue the process.</p>
		<img alt="admin map loading completion popup" src="../images/OEDAdminMapUploadComplete.png"
			style="width: 20vw; min-width: 250px;">
		<p>You should now be on the map calibration page shown below. This page allows you to enter the GPS
			coordinates for
			places on the map so OED can map locations on the map to locations on the globe (world map). You should
			place
			your curser that will appear as a "+" symbol at the point on the map that you wish to enter the GPS
			coordinate
			for. As you move your mouse, you will see the x and y coordinates on the map grid which span from 300 in
			the
			x-direction to 500 in the y-direction. These can be less depending on the aspect ratio of your map since
			they
			might be clipped in one direction to make the map fit the grid coordinate system. In the figure below,
			the
			cursor was placed at grid coordinate (277, 461) and then the mouse was clicked. (Unfortunately the image
			cannot
			pick up the "+" where the cursor was located.) This point was chosen since we assume that in a real
			situation we
			knew the GPS coordinate for the top, right corner of the "Swimming Pool" building in the image.</p>
		<img alt="admin map calibration point entry" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepOne.png">
		<p>As shown in the figure above, when that point was clicked, a message appeared below the map (inside the
			blue box
			used for highlighting) that says "input GPS coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461
			in this format -> latitude,longitude". This confirms that the coordinate clicked was (277, 461). As the
			message
			states, you need to enter the GPS coordinate for this point on the map as a latitude, longitude pair
			separated
			by a comma. This is a common format for GPS coordinates but do not include parentheses when you enter
			the GPS
			value such as they are written above. You enter the GPS value in the box below this message.
			For this example, the GPS coordinate entered was 40.00461, -87.99723. The box where this
			was
			entered
			is inside the blue box used for highlighting as shown in the next figure.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map GPS entry for a calibration point" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepTwo.png">
		<p>Once complete, you click the "Submit" button below the box for GPS (inside the blue box used for
			highlighting).
			This leads to the figure below. The text at the bottom of the web browser window, "result: Need more
			points"
			(highlighted with a blue box) indicates the result. It is stating that there are too few points to
			complete the
			calibration. OED needs a minimum of three points to calculate the error and possibly complete the
			calibration.
			Also note that the message will change the GPS value to "undefined" so it becomes "input GPS coordinate
			that
			corresponds to the point: undefined
			in this format -> latitude,longitude" after you submit a point. This is to indicate that a new point has
			yet to
			be chosen.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map showing need more calibration points" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepThree.png">
		<p>You now need to repeat the steps above to enter more calibration points. You can click anywhere on the
			map where
			you know the GPS coordinates. It is okay to click more than once to replace the point clicked with a new
			one as
			long
			as it is before you "Submit" the GPS value. See below for <a href="#calibrationPoints">suggestions on
				points to
				use and how to get
				the GPS coordinates</a> for
			points on the map. Once you have entered at least three calibration points, OED will give you an
			estimate of the
			overall calibration result (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the figure below).</p>
		<img alt="admin map showing result of current calibration points"
			src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepFour.png">
		<p>In this example, the result is "result: x: 1.202% y: 0.25%" (inside the blue box used for highlighting in
			the
			figure above). (Note the points used were deliberately shifted a little bit so a small error is shown.)
			If you
			are satisfied with the result, you click the "Save changes to
			database" (inside the blue box used for highlighting). See below for a discussion of the <a
				href="#calibrationResult">Calibration Result</a>. If at any time you want to begin the calibration
			process
			again, you can click the "Reset" button. If the calibration is a little worse than you want, you can try
			to
			add more points to improve the error but this is not guaranteed to work. Once you save the
			calibration, you are taken to the <a href="../adminMapViewing/">Admin Map Viewing</a> page that is
			shown below
			for
			a
			single
			map. If you want users to be able to see the map then make sure "Display Enabled" is shown. It is best
			to verify
			that items are showing up in the correct places before you reveal the map to users. Note you can
			recalibrate
			a map from this page. There are other values you can set and see that are described on
			the <a href="../adminMapViewing/">Admin Map Viewing</a> page.</p>
		<img alt="admin map viewing page after calibration" src="../images/OEDAdminMapViewingAfterCalibration.png">
		<p>Once you set the GPS of meters, you can see their values on the map. (See the <a href="../mapGraphic/">map
				graphing</a> page for more information.) If you find that the circles are not showing up at the
			desired
			points, then see the section on <a href="#circlePlacementIssues">circle placement issues</a> below.</p>

		<p>You can repeat this process for as many maps as you want.</p>

		<h3 id="angle">True north angle</h3>
		<p>To properly display maps, OED needs to know the vector that points to true
			north on the uploaded map. This is the clockwise angle between straight up on the map image you upload
			and true
			north. If your map image is oriented to north at the top then the angle is 0. If not, you need to
			determine the
			angle. For example, suppose the Happy Place map used above was rotated 30 degrees clockwise. This would
			give the
			following image:</p>
		<img alt="Happy Place map rotated 30 degrees with up and true north vectors along with angle between"
			src="../images/HappyPlace30Deg.png" style="width: 10vw; min-width: 300px;">
		<p>Let's assume the original map was oriented to true north. The arrow labeled true north shows this
			direction. The
			other arrow labeled straight up points directly to to top of the image (and is parallel to the
			corresponding
			sides of the image). The pink arrow labeled angle is the angle between the two arrows and the direction
			indicates the direction of the OED needed angle. In this case the angle is 30 degrees from straight up
			to true
			north. You would enter this value for the angle when inputting the map. Note that the GPS coordinates
			you enter
			for any meter or group is the actual one and is not changed by this rotation angle.</p>
		<p>Note that normally you have a rectangular image that is oriented to how people view your organization in
			this
			map. Thus, you would not normally rotate the map image as was done here for example purposes. Instead,
			you use
			the angle to tell OED what is going on.</p>
		<p>So, how can you get the angle needed. Sometimes the person or group that created the image of your
			organization
			knows this value, esp. if it was created with a GIS system. If not, you can use a mapping program on the
			web
			(such
			as Google Maps). These generally put true north at the top. If you take a screenshot of the area on the
			mapping
			program you want, you can then rotate the image until it aligns with the one you want to upload into
			OED. The
			angle that you needed to rotate the map is the value OED needs. Please note that
			some graphics programs/descriptions rotate the image and some rotate the coordinate system so you should
			be
			careful when getting the value from a graphics program. These values are just negatives of each other so
			checking if it follows the image above tells you if you need to negate the angle value. If the graphing
			does not
			produce the desired result, you
			may need to adjust this angle.</p>

		<h3 id="calibrationPoints">Choosing calibration points and finding the GPS value</h3>
		<p>OED uses the distance between calibration points to determine the quality of the points (called the
			"result"
			above). Spreading the points around the map increases the distance between the points. This is more
			likely to
			lead to correct placement of points around the entire map. If possible this should be done but not if it
			means
			you cannot get accurate GPS values for each calibration point entered.</p>
		<p>You can determine the GPS value of the calibration points in any way you wish. A way that is often
			accurate and
			easy is to use an online mapping site that contains an image that allows you to locate the same points
			that are
			contained in the image you will use inside OED. You can then click on that point on the map to get the
			GPS
			value. While OED does not endorse any particular online map, a popular one is Google Maps. With this you
			can
			left click on any point on a map to reveal information about that point. The first one is the GPS
			coordinates.
			If you right click on the GPS coordinate it will copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this
			value into
			the OED box to input GPS coordinates during the calibration steps described above. Another technique is
			to
			physically go to the point on the map and use a cell phone application that shows your current GPS
			location.
			Whatever technique you use, it is important to get accurate values so your calibration is of high
			quality.</p>

		<h3 id="calibrationResult">Calibration result</h3>
		<p>OED gives a result that provides an idea of how far off the calibration points are from each other. This
			may give
			you an idea of how accurately OED will place circles on the map. For example, three calibration points
			were
			entered on the map above where each one was changed by +/- 0.0001, which is changes in the 6th digit.
			This was
			done so the first calibration point had latitude and longitude increased by this amount, the second
			subtracted
			by this amount and the third had latitude increased and longitude decreased by this amount. As such, it
			was
			somewhat random if the value increased or decreased. For example, 40.00461, -87.99723 for the first
			point became
			40.00471, -87.99713. This lead to a result of "result: x: 15.471%, y: 4.356%". This is the example used
			in the
			figure below. If you map circles that should
			be directly on "Play Place" and "Theater" you get the following. As seen, they have moved a little to
			the more
			accurate calibration above but are in the correct general place.</p>
		<img alt="admin map small calibration error result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultOne.png">
		<p>If we change so that
			the each value is +/- 0.001 as done above then the result is much worse. The result is "result: x:
			76.423%, y:
			31.293%". The result of mapping is shown in the next figure where there are much more noticeable shifts.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger calibration error result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultTwo.png">
		<p>If we increased the change even further then the circles would shift even more and might eventually be
			off the
			map. When placement is poor, you need to recalibrate the map.</p>
		<p>Note that the error may not always indicate how poor placement will be. If every point was shifted a
			positive
			amount of +0.001 then OED will not find a calibration error due to the systematic shift but items placed
			on the
			map will be changed (assuming there is not a similar error in where meters are located). This example
			gives a
			result of "result: x: 0%, y: 0%" and the graphic shown next. Here the "Play Place" meter is no longer on
			the
			map.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger shift in one direction but no error" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultThree.png">
		<p>There are many possible reasons that the calibration might be off and we discuss several now. First, it
			is easy
			to type in the wrong value for a point. If this happens then correctly reentering the calibration values
			again
			will fix the issue. Second, a value for a calibration point is wrong. While a similar result to the
			first issue,
			it means rechecking each point to see which one(s) might be off. Third, the accuracy of the points is
			too low.
			This requires using another technique to get the values. This can happen, for example, if the map you
			used to
			get the GPS coordinates has features placed at a different location than on the map you uploaded to OED.
			It
			could also happen because manually read GPS values (such as going to a place and using the value shown
			of your
			cell phone) are off. This is due to the inherent accuracy of the device in getting the GPS coordinate or
			standing in the correct location. Finally, it is possible that the true north angle is off. This will
			generally
			lead to items not showing up on the map and/or being off across all meters/groups. While many issues can
			happen,
			the OED project found that getting the correct
			value is usually possible and led to good placement on the map. Getting a good calibration is the
			easiest way to
			place items on the map. See the next section for ideas on fixing poor placement of the circles on the
			map.</p>

		<h3 id="circlePlacementIssues">Circle placement issues</h3>
		<p>If you have done the best you can to calibrate the map but you still have circle(s) in the wrong place
			then you
			can manually fix them in the meter GPS value. OED only uses the GPS value for placing items on maps so
			fudging
			this value does not have other consequences or lead to incorrect results. This is usually easiest if the
			circles
			are reasonably close to the desired location on the map. Going back to the first calibration error
			example where
			it was +/-0.0001, we can see that "Play Place" is a little off but "Theater" seems fine. We notice it is
			somewhat to the down and right from the middle of that building. Looking at GPS values for this map
			indicates
			that as you go up the longitude gets larger and as you go left the longitude gets smaller (more
			negative). The
			correct meter GPS for "Play Place" is (40.00419, -87.99916). Noting that the GPS for "Theater" is
			(40.0027,
			-87.9975) we know that the changes needed are small so we start with (40.00469, -87.99966) (changed by
			0.0005).
			By using the
			<a href="../adminMapViewing/">Admin Map Viewing</a> page, the GPS value was changed for "Place Place"
			to this
			value. This moved "Play Place"
			much too far up and left so we now tried (40.00420, -87.99917) but the shift was too small. Next we
			tried
			(40.00429, -87.99926) and this worked fairly well as shown in the next figure. We could have done some
			more
			adjustment to slightly shift the "Play Place" circle if we wanted.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger calibration error fixed result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationFixed.png">
		<p>One thing to note is that this process is only done once when a new map is loaded. After that, any user
			will see
			the correct result. Also, once you move one point on the map it becomes clearer the amount needed for
			other
			circles so it usually takes less time.</p>
		<p>There are circumstance that can make it impossible to modify the meter GPS to get it in the correct place
			on the
			map. One is if the needed correction means the GPS value goes outside allowed values then OED will not
			allow the
			entry of this GPS value. This should only happen if the calibration is off significantly and should be
			rectified
			if the map calibration is redone with greater accuracy. A second is if two maps overlap in area so
			changing the
			GPS of a meter causes one map to be fine but another now has it in the wrong place. Proper calibration
			is the
			solution in this case.</p>
