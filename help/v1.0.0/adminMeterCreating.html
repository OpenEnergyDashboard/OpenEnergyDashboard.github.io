	<h1>Admin Meter Creating (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user. </p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin meter creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to creating a new
		meter on an OED site. It is accessed from
		the <a href="./adminMeterViewing.html">admin meter viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
		Meter" button near the top of that page.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Admin meter creating popup" src="./images/adminMeterCreatingPopupOne.png"></p>
	<p><img alt="Admin meter creating popup" src="./images/adminMeterCreatingPopupTwo.png"></p>
	<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identifier. This is the "name" of the meter shown when <a href="graphingMeters.html">graphing
				meters</a>. The identifier of a meter must be different from any other meter. If no identifier is
			provided then the name provided is automatically used.</li>
		<li>Name. This is the name of the meter. It is often the same as the identifier but can differ. There are two
			values because OED sometimes needs to internally use a special name that is not very user friendly so the
			identifier is also useful. Sites can also use this name for similar or other reasons when they want
			something other than what is displayed to the user. The name of a meter must be different from any other
			meter. This field will be outlined in red until a name is input as
			is shown in the figures.</li>
		<li>Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the unit that the meter collects in. This is related
			but different than the <a href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a> used. Some information on the meter
			unit is given on the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a> page. The result of
			clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterUnitDropdown.png" style="width:249">
		<p>All units of meter type will be shown and can be
			selected by clicking it if it is compatible with the default graphic unit. The compatible/selectable units
			will be at the top of the dropdown menu and the
			incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. In the following figure, the
			compatible units are in the blue Rectangle and the incompatible units are in the light blue rectangle where
			the
			default graphic unit was already set to kWh.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices separated by compatible and incompatible"
			src="./images/adminMeterUnitDropdownSeparated.png" style="width:249">
		<p>A meter unit is compatible with
			the default graphic unit as long as there is a
			conversion that exists between them. Note that if "no unit" is selected for the default graphic unit then
			every
			unit is compatible with that (see first figure of Unit dropdown). Meters can only collect in
			units of meter type and must be linked by a conversion to a regular unit for graphing. There is a choice of
			"no
			unit" on this menu but it is generally not used. If this is selected then the meter can collect data but
			would be unusable for graphics. The default graphic unit is automatically set to "no unit" when the meter
			unit is set to that value. It is mostly used internally by OED for automatically creating meters where
			the unit is not known and then the admin needs to set this unit afterward. If one needs to
			select a different unit that does not have a conversion to the current unit then selecting "no unit" for the
			default graphic
			unit will allow that selection. This field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</p>
		<li>Default Graphic Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection a compatible <a
				href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a>
			that is used if one is not
			already selected before this meter is chosen. It allows a site to automatically display a meter in its
			preferred graphic unit. For example, a site might prefer to graph a meter in US $ (money) even though it
			collects
			in kWh. Even if the default graphic unit is the same as the meter unit it must be set separately. A default
			graphic unit is compatible with the meter unit if a
			conversion exists between them. As with the meter unit, the compatible/selectable units will be at the top
			of the dropdown menu and the
			incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. Initially this menu will only
			have "no unit" as compatible because that is the only
			compatible unit with a "no unit" meter unit as shown in the following figure.</li>

		<img alt="Admin meter default graphic unit choices when no meter unit"
			src="./images/adminMeterDguNoUnitDropdown.png" style="width:248">
		<p>The dropdown menu when the meter unit is already set to Electric_Utility is shown in the following figure.
			All units from Celsius and below are not compatible and grayed out.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterDguEuDropdown.png" style="width:248">
		<p>If "no unit" is selected then this meter cannot be graphed until a compatible unit is already selected. This
			field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</p>
		<li>Updates. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). If "yes" and OED knows how to automatically
			acquire readings from this meter then it will be done whenever the site automatically acquires readings from
			meters. (See information on <a href="./adminInstallation.html">site installation</a> about automatic meter
			reading acquisition.) If "no" then no data will automatically be acquired for this meter.</li>
		<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). "yes" indicates the meter
			can be seen and graphed by any user and "no" limits the meter visibility and graphing to admins. Note
			displayable must be "no" if the meter unit is "no unit" and this will be indicated if it is not set this way
			and changed when saved.
		<li>Type. This dropdown menu allows for setting the type of a meter which is generally the vendor associated
			with
			it. As the following figure shows, OED currently knows about a few types of meters and can acquire their
			data
			directly. If you want and can to use a meter not on this list then select "OTHER". See the page on <a
				href="./adminDataAcquisition.html">data acquisition</a> for more information. Please <a
				href="../../contact.html">contact us</a> if you want to use meters that OED does not yet support. This
			field will be outlined in red
			until a type is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</li>
		<img alt="Admin meter type choices" src="./images/adminMeterTypeDropdown.png" style="width:248">
		<li>Reading Frequency. This defines the rate at which OED receives readings from this meter. It impacts the
			<a href="./lineGraphic.html#lineQuality">quality of data seen in a line graphic</a> and the estimates of
			the <a href="./export.html#exportSize">size of exported data files</a> since it is used to estimate the
			number of points in the range of time requested. The standard
			format is HH:MM:SS, e.g., 00:15:00 for 15 minutes, but OED can also accept other formats such as 3 hours or
			4 days. The default value is the one on the <a href="./adminPreferences.html">admin preferences page</a>
			that will default to 00:15:00 for 15 minutes unless changed by the admin.
		</li>
		<li>URL. This is the URL used when OED automatically acquires readings during <a
				href="./adminDataAcquisition.html">data acquisition</a>. The value is meter type specific and shown on
			the help
			page about each meter. It can be left blank if not needed by this meter type.</li>
		<li>GPS. This is the GPS location of the meter entered as latitude, longitude (without parentheses). It is used
			when the values from
			the meter are placed on a <a href="./mapGraphic.html">map graphic</a>. More information on using the best
			GPS
			value is given on the <a href="./adminMap.html.html">admin help page for maps</a>. If blank then there is no
			GPS value and the meter cannot be placed on a map.</li>
		<li>Area. A non-negative number of the area associated with the meter. It is used when <a
				href="./areaNormalization.html">normalizing graphics by area</a>. It has a default value of zero
			that means this meter cannot be normalized by area. The default value will be used if the input is left
			blank.
			This field will be outlined in red until valid value (including blank) is entered if an invalid value is
			entered.</li>
		<li>Meter Area Unit. This dropdown menu can have the values shown in the following figure. The usable area units
			are "sq. feet" and "sq. meters". If "no unit" is selected then the field will be red if the area is non-zero
			because OED needs to know the unit of the area. The default value is "no unit" and this can be used if the
			area is reset back to zero so the choice is valid.</li>
		<img alt="Admin meter area unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterAreaUnitDropdown.png" style="width:254">
		<li>Note. This may give additional information about the meter supplied when OED created it or from the
			admin. Any text can be entered and it can be blank if desired.</li>
		<li>Cumulative. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). If "yes", then the readings on this
			meter increase with each successive reading and represent the total usage over time. This means that the
			reading value for a reading's time range is determined by subtracting the value of the previous reading from
			the current
			reading. If "no", then the meter is not cumulative and each reading represents the usage for the time range
			of
			this reading.</li>
		<li>Cumulative Reset. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). Some cumulative meters periodically
			reset the total back to zero. If "yes" then this can happen and "no" means it does not. Whenever a reset
			occurs (the current reading is
			less than the previous reading) then the value for that reading is directly used. If a reset is detected and
			is outside the times specified (see next two parameters) then OED will reject all readings in the current
			batch supplied to OED due to
			the error.</li>
		<li>Cumulative Reset Start. The earliest time of each day that cumulative reset can occur. By limiting the time
			that OED accepts a cumulative reset, OED is able to report issues outside that time. The input format is
			HH:MM:SS.ss, e.g. 10:11:22.33, where the fractions of a second can be omitted, e.g. 12:24:36. If no value is
			provided (empty text box) then the value will default to 00:00:00 which means the start of the day. The
			start of the day should be used if one wants to allow a cumulative reset at any time. This
			value is not used if cumulative reset is no. There
			are several types of invalid time values that will produce the following errors on input when you save:<ul>
				<li>Invalid times such as letters or negative values (-10:00:00 here) will produce the error: "Failed to
					edit meter with message: "error: invalid input syntax for type time: "-10:00:00" with
					detail undefined"</li>
				<li>Times that are more than 24 hours so not within a day (24:50:00 here) will produce the error:
					"Failed
					to edit meter with message: "error: date/time field value out of range: "24:50:00" with
					detail undefined"</li>
				<li>If the reset start time is not before the reset end time (start of 10:00:01, end of 10:00:00 here)
					will
					produce the error (other provided meter values are included and shown here): "Failed to edit meter
					with message: "error: new row for relation "meters" violates check constraint
					"meter_cumulative_reset" with detail Failing row contains (121, zz, , f, f, other, null, null, zz, ,
					0, f, f, 10:00:01, 10:00:00, 0, 0, 1, increasing, f, 0, 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00, 1970-01-01
					00:00:00+00:00, 1970-01-01 00:00:00, 152, 158, none, PT15M)."</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Cumulative Reset End. The latest time of each day that cumulative reset can occur. Similar input, errors and
			usage to Cumulative Reset Start. If no value is
			provided (empty text box) then the value will default to 23:59:59.999999 meanings the end of the day. The
			end of the day should be used if one wants to allow a cumulative reset at any time. This
			value is not used if cumulative reset is no.</li>
		<li>End Only Time. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). "yes" if each reading for this meter only
			has an end
			date/time stamp and no start time stamp meaning a reading has two values (reading value and end date/time
			stamp).
			"no" if it has three values for each reading (reading value, start date/time stamp and end date/time stamp).
			OED
			will automatically convert an end only time reading to have a start time by using the previous reading's
			time stamp as is
			normal for these type of reading.</li>
		<li>Reading Gap. A non-negative number of how many seconds are considered normal between the end of one reading
			and the start of the next reading. A value of zero (default value) indicates that there should never be a
			gap in readings and they
			always abut each other. OED will issue a warning each time it sees a reading that
			has a gap greater than the meter allows whenever readings are acquired for this meter.</li>
		<li>Reading Variation. A non-negative number of how may seconds the length of one reading can vary for the
			length of the next reading (end date/time - start date/time). A value of zero (default value) indicates that
			all
			readings should be of the same length. OED will issue a warning each time it sees a reading that
			has a length variation greater than the meter allows whenever readings are acquired for this meter.</li>
		<li>Reading Duplication. A positive integer of how many times each reading is duplicated when the meter
			provides values. There are some meters that give the same readings multiple times in a row. Ones that do not
			should have a value of 1 (default). For example, if the value is 3 then OED reads the first reading of each
			three readings and ignores the next two. If a non-integer is input then after one saves the error
			message "Failed to create meter with message: "validation failed with instance.readingDuplication is not of
			a
			type(s) integer" will be shown. The number of duplications must be between 1 and 9. If it is outside this
			range then this field will be outlined in red until a valid value is input.</li>
		<li>Time Sort. This dropdown menu can be "increasing" (default) or "decreasing". If "increasing" then readings
			are supplied so later ones in time are later in each batch of reading supplied to OED. If "decreasing" then
			later times
			come earlier in each batch of reading supplied to OED.</li>
		<li>Start Time Stamp. This is less commonly used. It is the start date/time stamp of the last reading processed
			in
			the last batch of readings received by OED for this meter. Normally this value is automatically set by OED
			each time it processes a batch of data. In unusual circumstances of manual batch loading of data into OED
			this may need to be set. This value is used when the last processed reading from the last batch
			is needed to determine information. This happens for end only meters and cumulative meters and also used to
			generate warnings in some cases about reading variation and gap. The standard format for input is YYYY-MM-DD
			HH:MM:SS, e.g., 2020-05-22 13:15:45. If no value is provided (empty text field) then the default value of
			1970-01-01 00:00:00 is used and OED understands this special value as not having yet read data and will deal
			with it appropriately.</li>
		<li>End Time Stamp. This is less commonly used. It is the end date/time stamp of the last reading processed in
			the last batch of readings received by OED for this meter. It is similar to the Start Time Stamp and has the
			same default.</li>
		<li>Reading. This is less commonly used. It is the reading value of the last reading processed in
			the last batch of readings received by OED for this meter. It has the default value of zero.</li>
		<li>Time Zone. The timezone of this meter as text. OED can accept most standard time zone names such as <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" rel="noopener noreferrer">this
				Wikipedia one</a>
			where the "TZ identifier" is used, e.g., Pacific/Galapagos for the Galápagos Islands. The time zone of a
			meter only needs to be set if the meter readings are time zone aware. For example, eGauge meters are time
			zone aware and can provide data that accounts for daylight savings. This sets the time zone for this meter
			and overrides the <a href="adminPreferences.html">site
				preferences</a> time zone value.
			This is useful if some meters are not in the same time zone as the site default. See the <a
				href="time.html">time
				help page</a> for further information.</li>
		<li>Previous End Time Stamp. This is less commonly used. It is similar to the End Time Stamp but for the next to
			last (penultimate; one before the End Time Stamp) reading processed in
			the last batch of readings received by OED for this meter. Normally this value is automatically set by OED
			each time it processes a batch of data. It is only used for meters that have a time zone
			and honor daylight savings such as eGauge. It is only really important for detecting when time crosses
			daylight savings. It is similar to the Start Time Stamp and has the same default.</li>
