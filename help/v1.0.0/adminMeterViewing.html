	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin meter viewing page allows admin users to see all information on meters on an OED site. It is
		accessed
		from
		the <a href="./pageChoices.html">"Pages" dropdown menu</a> by clicking "Meters" as shown in the following
		figure (highlighted in the blue
		rectangle where "Meters" is grayed out since it has already been clicked). This page also allows admins to
		<a href="./adminMeterCreating.html">create</a> and <a href="./adminMeterEditing.html">edit</a>
		meters. Admins will see more columns than the typical user
		as shown in the next figure and described below.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Admin meter viewing page" src="./images/adminMeterViewingPage.png"></p>
	<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, each meter has its own card to show information about that meter. The
		cards are arranged alphabetically from left to right and top to bottom by the meter's identifier.
		Each card contains the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Meter Identifier. This is the "name" of the meter shown when <a href="graphingMeters.html">graphing
				meters</a>. It is at the top of each card in blue. Note this is referred to as name on this page for a
			non-admin user to avoid added confusion about identifier versus name since they never see the identifier.</li>
		<li>Name. This is the name of the meter. It is often the same as the identifier but can differ. There are two
			values because OED sometimes needs to internally use a special name that is not very user friendly so the
			identifier is also useful. Sites can also use this name for similar or other reasons when they want
			something other than what is displayed to the user.</li>
		<li>Unit. This indicates the unit that the meter collects in. This is related but different than the <a
				href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a> used. Some information on the meter unit is given on the <a
				href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a> page.</li>
		<li>Default Graphic Unit. This tells the <a href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a> used if one is not
			already selected before this meter is chosen.</li>
		<li>Displayable. This controls whether regular users can see a meter and graph it. It is "yes" in green if
			everyone can see/graph this meter and "no" in red if only admins can see/graph this meter.
		<li>Note. This may give additional information about the meter supplied when OED created it or from the
			admin. Only the first 30 characters will be shown and any additional characters in the note can be seen by
			clicking the "Edit Meter" button.</li>
		<li>Edit Meter button. Clicking this button allows one to see a lot additional information on this meter
			and to <a href="./adminMeterEditing.html">edit the values associated with this meter</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition, there is a "Create a Meter" button near the top of the page that allows one to <a
			href="./adminMeterCreating.html">create a new meter</a>.</p>
