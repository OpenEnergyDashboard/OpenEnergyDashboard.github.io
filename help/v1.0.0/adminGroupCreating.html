	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin group creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to create a new
		group on an OED site. It is accessed from
		the <a href="./adminGroupViewing.html">admin group viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
		Group" button near the top of that page.
	</p>
	<img alt="Admin group creating popup" src="./images/adminGroupCreatingPopup.png" style="width: 592">
	<p>All example information shown on this web page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help
			example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Name. This is the name of the group. The name of a group must be different from any other
			group. Though not required it is a good idea to give a group a different name from any meter identifier
			because it can
			be difficult to tell them apart in a graphic if they are the same. This field will be outlined in red
			until a name is input as
			is shown in the figure.</li>
		<li>Default Graphic Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection a compatible <a
				href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a>
			that is used if one is not
			already selected before this group is chosen. It allows a site to automatically display a group in its
			preferred graphic unit. A default
			graphic unit is compatible with the group if a
			conversion exists between all meters in this group and the unit. The compatible/selectable units will be at
			the top
			of the dropdown menu and the
			incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. Initially this menu will only
			have "no unit" as compatible because that is the only
			compatible unit with an empty group as shown in the following figure.</li>

		<p>The dropdown menu when the meter "Dining Hall Electric" that collects in kWh is the only child meter is shown
			in the following figure.
			All units from Celsius and below are not compatible and grayed out.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="./images/adminGroupDguEuDropdown.png" style="width:281">
		<p>If "no unit" is selected then this group cannot be graphed until a compatible unit is already selected. It
			has a default value of "no unit".</p>
		<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). "yes" indicates the group
			can be seen and graphed by any user and "no" limits the group visibility and graphing to admins.
		<li>GPS. This is the GPS location of the group entered as latitude, longitude (without parentheses). It is used
			when the values from
			the group are placed on a <a href="./mapGraphic.html">map graphic</a>. More information on using the best
			GPS
			value is given on the <a href="./adminMapCreating.html">admin help page for creating maps</a>. If blank then there is no
			GPS value and the group cannot be placed on a map.</li>
		<li>Area. A non-negative number of the area associated with the group. It is used when <a
				href="./areaNormalization.html">normalizing graphics by area</a>. It has a default value of zero
			that means this group cannot be normalized by area. The default value will be used if the input is left
			blank.
			This field will be outlined in red until valid value (including blank) is entered if an invalid value is
			entered.</li>
		<li>Calculate Group Area. Knowing the total area that all meters in a group represents can be complex.To help
			with this, OED can automatically calculate the area of the group from all the included meters (not just the
			directly included ones). The group
			must have an "Area Unit" (not "no unit"
			) to be able to do this and a popup will say "No group area unit" if there is no area unit set. Note that
			the
			underlying meters can be in any area unit but OED can still calculate
			the value in the unit requested. Clicking this button will cause OED to calculate this area and it will then
			display the resulting value. For example, if the group contains "Dining Hall Electric", "Great Dorm 1st
			Floor
			Electric" And "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" then clicking this button will result in the popup in the next
			figure.</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="./images/adminGroupAreaCalc.png" style="width:445">
		<p>If one clicks "OK" (the default) then the value for area display will be placed in the area input and it will
			overwrite any existing value. If one clicks "Cancel" then nothing is changed. In this example the area is
			11000 because the area of "Dining Hall Electric" is 1000, "Great Dorm 1st Floor
			Electric" is 5000 and "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" is 5000 so the sum is 11000.</p>
		<p>It is not required that all meters have an associated area. If a group includes such a meter then OED will
			give a warning when it calculates the area of the group because it cannot include anything for that meter.
			If the
			previous example was modified to include a fourth meter of "Other building" that does not have an area then
			the
			popup in the next figure would appear when you calculate the area.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="./images/adminGroupAreaCalcNoArea.png" style="width:445">
		<p>As stated, the area calculated does not include anything for this meter. Note if one clicks "OK" and sets the
			area for this group, it is possible to manually edit this value to include any missing meters. While this
			example shows one meter, any meters without an area will be listed in the popup.</p>
		<li>Area Unit. This dropdown menu can have the values shown in the following figure. The usable area units
			are "sq. feet" and "sq. meters". If "no unit" is selected then the field will be red if the area is non-zero
			because OED needs to know the unit of the area. The default value is "no unit" and this can be used if the
			area is reset back to zero so the choice is valid.</li>
		<!-- Reuse meter one since menu is the same. -->
		<img alt="Admin group area unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterAreaUnitDropdown.png" style="width:155">
		<li>Note. This may give additional information about the group supplied by the
			admin. Any text can be entered and it can be blank if desired.</li>
		<li>Child Meters. This area lists all the meters directly included into this group along with the ability to
			change them. A meter can be removed by clicking the "x" to the right of its name. The dropdown menu can be
			used to select another meter to include into this group. A meter is compatible with the group if a
			conversion exists between all meters in this group and the meter. Unlike many dropdown menus in OED, all the
			possible meters are listed alphabetically because there are several possible states for any meter. In the
			following figure, an example is shown where the "Dining Hall Electric" meter is already a member of this
			group and the default graphic unit is "no unit". This meter collects in kWh (energy unit) and is compatible
			with energy, CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $. The meters shown
			are displayed as
			follows (there are more meters in the dropdown menu that are not shown):
			<ul>
				<li>Adding this meter to the group will not change the group's possible compatible units. Such meters
					are
					shown in regular font and are selectable. In the following figure, "Library Electric" and "Theater
					Electric" are displayed this way because they are all collecting in an energy unit (kWh) and are
					completely compatible with each other.</li>
				<li>Adding this meter to the group will change the group's possible compatible units but the reduced
					compatible units still include the current default graphic unit. Such meters are
					shown in orange font and are selectable. In the following figure, "Great Dorm Water" is displayed
					this way and is compatible with volume units,
					CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $. This group and the already selected meter are both compatible with
					CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $ so energy units will no longer be compatible. Selecting this meter is
					compatible with the default graphic unit because it is currently "no unit".</li>
				<li>Adding this meter to the group will change the group's possible compatible units so there are no
					compatible units. If OED allowed such a group then it could never be graphed
					so it is not
					allowed. Thus, the incompatible/non-selectable meters will be in grayed out font. In the following
					figure, "Library Temperature" is displayed this way because it is collecting in a temperature unit
					(Fahrenheit) and is not compatible only with temperature units. These are not
					compatible with any of the "Dining Hall Electric" meter units
					so there are no possible compatible units between them.</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
			<img alt="Admin group child meter choices" src="./images/adminGroupChildMeters.png" style="width:573">
			<p>The fourth possible display state of a meter is shown in the following figure. In this case the default
				graphic unit was changed to kWh. As a result, the meter "Great Dorm Water" is now in red. This
				indicates that the compatible units would change if this meter
				is selected and the current default
				graphic unit is not one of the changed compatible units (CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $). If this meter
				is chosen then the default
				graphic unit
				must be changed. OED will set the default graph unit to "no unit" and one needs to set it to a new
				compatible unit for this group if desired. These meters are shown in red to indicate that the group will
				automatically
				be changed. If the new meter is added to the group then a pop up will confirm the change to the group.
				In this example it would have "The default graphic unit was changed to no unit from "kWh"".</p>
			<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
			<img alt="Admin group child meter choices" src="./images/adminGroupChildMetersRed.png" style="width:573">
			<p>While the examples above use meters, any group included in this group also impacts the compatible units.
				Any of
				the meters that are in this group (see All Meters below) are included in the consideration of compatible
				units. Finally, a meter can always be removed from a group because it cannot reduce the compatible units
				so it will leave it the same or add more compatible units.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Child Groups. This area lists all the groups directly included into this group along with the ability to
			change them. A group can be removed by clicking the "x" to the right of its name. The dropdown menu can be
			used to select another group to include into this group. A group is compatible with the new group if a
			conversion exists between all meters in this group and all meters in the new group. Thus, the dropdown menu
			to select a new group has the same choices as the "Child Meters" dropdown menu and they represent the same
			thing. Because groups can contain multiple meters, it can be more difficult for one to determine the
			compatibility of groups but OED will do this automatically. The next figure shows what the group dropdown
			menu looks like from the first example in the Child Meters where the default graphic unit is "no unit".
			There are more groups below the ones shown.
			The reason for the group labeling can be determined by looking at the information in the <a
				href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</li>
		<!-- Maybe describe why one group does what it does as an example -->
		<p><img alt="Admin group group choices" src="./images/adminGroupChildGroupsRed.png"></p>
		<li>All Meters. Determining all meters that are included in a group can be difficult, especially given that
			groups can include groups (and those can include more groups). To help with this, this area shows all meters that are included in this group
			from all directly included meters and groups. The following figure shows the result for all meters for the
			meters and groups shown that will be included in this group. The reason for these meters can be determined
			by
			looking at the information in the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</li>
		<p><img alt="Admin all meters" src="./images/adminGroupAllMeters.png"></p>
	</ol>
	<p>There are two buttons at the bottom of the popup:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Discard changes. Clicking this button will remove all entries and close the popup. This means the next time
			that "Create a Group" is clicked all the values will be the default ones. Clicking outside the popup but
			within the OED web browser window will have the same effect.</li>
		<li>Save all. Clicking this button will save the new group with the provided entries.</li>
	</ul>
