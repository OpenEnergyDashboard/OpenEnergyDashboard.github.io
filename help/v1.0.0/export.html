	<h1>Exporting Data (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>OED is an open system that believes that your site data belongs to you and should be readily available. The
		ability to export data is the feature that lets you get the data. You may want to do this to work on it outside
		OED or to transfer the data to another system. OED uses the vendor neutral CSV (Comma Separated Value)
		spreadsheet format for exported data.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

	<h3>Line graphics</h3>
	<p>One nice feature is that you get the data associated with the graphic you are displaying. This means you can
		select meters/groups, time ranges to plot, etc. and visualize them in OED before you export the data. Once the
		graphic contains the data you want, you can either click the "Export graph data" button or "Export raw graph
		data" button (both inside blue box in next
		figure which is for a user with admin privileges) to initiate the export.</p>
	<img alt="Export graph data button" src="./images/OEDExportButton.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The "Export graph data" will give you the points on the OED graphic that is being displayed. The size of the
		exported file will not be large because you are getting the graphic points as described in the
		<a href="lineGraphic.html#averaging">line graphic details</a>. The "Export raw graph data" will give you the
		original (raw) meter data that was used to create the graphic. Since this is the raw meter data, group data on
		display in the graph are not included in the export of raw data.
	</p>
	<p>The size of this CSV file scales with the number
		of meter points and can be large. To avoid accidental or inappropriate downloads of large files, OED does the
		following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the file size is small (normally set to 5MB) then the file is automatically downloaded when the button is
			clicked. You do not need to be logged in to perform these exports. </li>
		<li>If the file size is medium (normally 5-25MB) then the user must have CSV download privileges. This means you
			must be logged in as a user with either CSV or admin rights. If you have CSV privileges then you will be
			told the expected file size and ask to verify you wish to download the file. If you have admin privileges
			then the file will automatically download.</li>
		<li>If the file size is large (normally more than 25MB) then the user must have admin privileges. You will be
			told the expected file size and ask to verify you wish to download the file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that you will be told you cannot download the data if you don't have appropriate privileges. The download of
		the raw data as a CSV will take longer than the network transfer time because OED must get the data from the
		database and format into a CSV.</p>
	<p>
		A CSV file will be placed where your downloaded web browser files go. It will be
		named
		"oedExport...." or "oedRawExport...." where the .... has the graphic type and date ranges involved. For example,
		the exported data for
		the graphic shown in
		the figure above had the name "oedExport_line_April_2_2020_12_00_00_AM_to_August_5_2020_12_00_00_AM.csv" and for
		the raw export it had the name "oedRawExport_line_April_1_2020_1_00_00_AM_to_August_6_2020_2_00_00_PM.csv". Note
		that the dates are slightly earlier and later in the name for the raw file. This is due to the fact that OED did
		some readings averaging on the line graph as described in the
		<a href="lineGraphic.html#averaging">line graphic details</a>. Also note that if different meters/groups have
		different ranges of dates then one of them will be used for the file name.
	</p>

	<h3>Bar graphics</h3>
	<p>Exporting bar graphics data is similar to line graphics except you only have the option to "Export graph data".
		You cannot export raw data since a bar graphic sums data over a range of time. The line graphic allows you to
		see the raw meter data if that is desired.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>You can export line and bar graphic data. You cannot export compare and map graphic data. There did not seem to
		be a need for compare and maps since compare has very limited data and maps are very much tied to the
		geographical location. Furthermore, the data shown on
		compare and maps is, in a general way, a subset of the bar graphic.</p>
	<p>The time range is considered the full time shown on the line graphic (not just
		the zoomed in time) so you will see that unless you redraw to reduce the time range. (see <a
			href="lineGraphic.html#redrawRestore">
			redraw</a> information)</p>
	<p>Since version 0.8.0, exported data includes both the start and end date/timestamp. This provides more information
		that could be useful. Also note that the first column is the meter/group name. You can import data that was
		exported by OED but you need to remove the first column and include the meter name in the import parameters.
		Finally, you can export multiple meters at a time but you can only have one meter of data for import. If you
		plan to import the exported data then do the export one meter at a time or you need to edit the CSV to break it
		up into one file for each meter.</p>
