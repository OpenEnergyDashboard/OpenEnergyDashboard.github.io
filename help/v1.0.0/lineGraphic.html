	<h1>OED Line Graphic (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>A line graphic shows each meter and group as a unique line showing usage across time. The
		following figure shows
		a line graphic of two meters of the floors of the "Great Dorm" and the group "Great Dorm Electric" which
		contains
		both of these floors. (<a href="./exampleDescription.html">information on example data</a>)
		Thus, the sum of the values of the two meter lines at any given time equals the group line value. The hover is
		shown whenever the curser
		is over a line and is accurate to 6 significant figures. It is the middle of the date/time range of represented
		by this point. In the figure below, the time in the hover is
		12:00:00 PM which is the middle of the day (noon) since the point spans an entire day. It is the same as the
		x-axis value. Each line represents power usage at that time for the indicated meter/group, e.g., kW for
		electricity with the graphing unit of kWh. To get
		this graphic, one clicks the "Line" choice (highlighted with a blue box) from the "Graph type" dropdown
		menu.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="line graphic with two meters and a group of those meters" src="./images/lineGraphic.png"></p>
	<p>A line graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, one can control
		the time frame (dates shown) on the line graphic.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>One selects the <a href="graphingMeters.html">meters</a> and/or <a href="graphingGroups.html">groups</a> to graph
		in the usual way. OED will display each meter or group as a uniquely colored line. One can select
		the <a href="./graphingUnits.html">units</a>, <a href="./areaNormalization.html">area normalization</a> and <a
			href="./chartLink.html">chart link</a> as usual. The <a href="graphingRates.html">rate</a> used to
		display the data can also be selected when it is appropriate.</p>
	<p>If the values of one or more meters (or groups) are substantially
		less than another meter (or group) then the values for these meters will be very close to the x-axis and
		difficult to see. This is seen in the following figure where "Library Electric" has substantially smaller values
		than "Great Dorm Electric".</p>
	<p><img alt="line graphic of two meters with substantially different values" src="./images/lineDifferentValues.png">
	</p>
	<p>One can more readily see these
		values by removing the values for the meters or groups with larger values. One way to do this is to remove a
		meter or group from graphing by clicking the "X" next to its name in the list (details on the <a
			href="graphingMeters.html">meters</a>/<a href="graphingGroups.html">groups</a> graphing help
		pages). This works but is slower since OED must recalculate the values via the server (see <a
			href="#details">details</a> below). It also means one won't see these meters/groups in other graphics since
		they were removed. A nice solution is to click on the name of the meter/group at the top of the line graphic. In
		the next figure, "Great Dorm Electric" was clicked (highlighted with blue box) and the graph quickly redrew to
		what is shown with the y-axis scale re-calibrated for the remaining meters. The meter not being shown is in
		shadow font. One can click to remove as many lines as desired.</p>
	<p><img id="lineHidden" alt="removing meter from a line graphic" src="./images/lineHidddenMeter.png"></p>
	<p>One can click on a meter/group in shadow font to get it to quickly reappear on the line graphic. Note that going
		to another graphic will reset the
		meters/groups shown so any hidden meters will show again.</p>

	<h3 id="scrollZoom">Scrolling and zooming</h3>
	<p>Initially, OED shows the line graphic across all time that is available. Sometimes one wants to look at a smaller
		time range. One can achieve this by zooming in the time (x) axis. This is done by clicking and dragging the
		rectangles with black border below the x-axis (highlighted with blue boxes in the figure below). As one slides
		the
		black rectangle, the parts of the x-axis (time) that is removed from the graph is show by a gray filled
		rectangle (highlighted in light blue boxes but also goes to center of the rectangle but not highlighted
		since
		then hard to see other blue box). The white area between the gray rectangles is the time being shown.
		In
		the figure below the original time was reduced to July through December, 2020.</p>
	<p><img alt="reducing time shown in a line graphic" src="./images/lineReducedTime.png"></p>
	<p>Once one is zoomed in so gray areas are shown for the removed time, one can click within these areas to modify
		the time range shown but the behavior is a little more complex and likely to take time to learn to use.</p>
	<p>If only part of the time is shown, then one can scroll to see the other times. The total time displayed remains
		the same but the times included change as one scrolls. One do this by clicking and dragging in the white area
		below the x-axis
		that shows the time being displayed (highlighted with blue box in the next figure). The next figure shows the
		process
		of dragging where the time displayed has now changed to January through June, 2021.</p>
	<p><img alt="scrolling time in a line graphic" src="./images/lineScrolled.png"></p>
	<p>If one zoom3 in significantly so the time range is much smaller than the original time range, the graph can become
		jagged due to having too few points. Also, one might want to return the graphic to its original, full time
		range. Both of these are discussed in the next section on the "Redraw" and "Restore" buttons.
	</p>
	<p>If one goes to another page then the zoomed values will be lost unless one redraws as described in the next section.
	</p>

	<h3 id="redrawRestore">Redraw and Restore buttons</h3>
	<p>The next figure shows the result of zooming in even farther so a limited time range of about one week is shown.
		It only shows one of the meters to simplify seeing the effect.</p>
	<p><img alt="zooming to a limited time range on a line graphic" src="./images/lineZoomed.png"></p>
	<p>As one can see, the line has become vague because the time points are far apart (still one day). This happens due
		to the limited
		number of points available from the original time frame graphic of several years. (see <a
			href="#redrawDetails">below</a> for the details of why). If one wants to see
		this time range with more
		points then click the "Redraw" button (highlighted with a blue box) as shown in the figure below. One can now
		see that many more points are present. In this case it is using the original meter data
		which is spaced 20 minutes apart.</p>
	<p><img alt="result of redrawing a line graphic" src="./images/lineRedraw.png"></p>
	<p>Note that the time range redrawn on a line graphic is also used for most other graphics (but not comparison).</p>
	<p>Because OED uses a rate on the line graphic (as discussed above), The reading's value does not dramatically
		change when the time frame is redrawn unless the averaging was for meter data that varied greatly. Note that
		once one does this, the time range is reset so one cannot zoom outward nor scroll to times outside the
		new range but one can zoom in farther. If one wants to see other time ranges, one can click
		the "Restore" button (highlighted with a blue
		box in the next figure) and the graph will return to its original view with the time range including all meters.
		The result of
		doing this is shown in the next figure. Notice that it matches the "Great Dorm 1st Floor Electric" line in the
		original figure at the
		top of this page when the different y-xis scales are taken into account.</p>
	<p><img alt="restoring time in a line graphic" src="./images/lineRestored.png"></p>
	<p id="lineQuality">As noted, when one clicks "Redraw" the data, OED recalculates the number of points to display. Part of that process is
		deciding the frequency, i.e., the time between points, that is shown. OED tries to return the highest quality
		data it can without returning too many graphing points. This means that it will first try to return meter data
		then hourly and finally daily data. At the current time, OED limits the number of graphic
		points for any individual line or meter to 1440 or less. OED has three qualities of graphic points that it uses:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Original Meter Data. If the range of time means that the number of meter points is small enough then OED
			will use the original meter data. This means that no averaging has been done and the graph shows what was
			received from the meter. This can be valuable if one wants to see exactly what the meter showed. As shown
			above, reducing the number of days on a line graphic can make this happen if the meter has a lot of reading.
			Note that groups cannot graph at the meter data level because meters with data at different times of
			readings do not align.
		</li>
		<li>Hourly. Each point represents one hour of data. OED automatically averages multiple readings
			within the hour and will properly account for missing meter points within the hour when there are still some
			points. When one hovers over a line in this case the time shown will be a half hour such as 9:30:00
			AM since the half hour is the midpoint of the time averaged.</li>
		<li>Daily. Each point represents one day of data. OED automatically averages multiple readings
			within the day and will properly account for missing meter points within the day when there are still some
			points. When one hovers over a line in this case the time shown will
			be 12:00:00 PM because that is the midpoint of the points averaged.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that each meter or group that is in a line graphic independently decides about the quality of its line
		graphic. This is done to give the maximum quality possible while not returning too many points in any line.
		Thus, it is possible to get meters on a line graphic that have different qualities. Since groups will not
		use meter data then they will definitely differ from meters that are displayed at this quality.</p>
	<p>OED will not return a quality of graphic readings that is higher than what a meter is supposed to supply data.
		For example, if a
		meter supplies data every four hours then the quality of data in a line graphic will not be hourly but could be
		every 4 hours or daily. As another
		example, if a meter only has data every 7 days then it would only graph that data every 7 days. Note that
		because
		the meter supplied data less frequently it is more likely that OED will graph the original meter data which is
		the highest quality data it has available.</p>
	<p>To give an idea of when OED uses each quality of graphic points, suppose one has a meter that supplies data
		every 15
		minutes. If the graphic time range is 15 days or less then OED will graph in original meter data. If the graphic
		time range is more than 15 days but 60 days
		or less then OED will graph hourly points. If it is more than 60 days then OED will graph daily points. OED
		uses the information the site provides for the frequency that a meter supplies data to make the determinations
		and
		does not take into account if the meter supplies data at a different rate.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

	<h3>Exporting graph data</h3>
	<p>one can export the data represented on a line graphic. one can use the line graph to get the time range,
		meters/groups, unit and rate one wants before exporting. See the <a href="export.html">export help page</a> for
		further information.</p>

	<h3>Plotly graph controls</h3>
	<p>As shown in the next figure, the Plotly (the underlying graphic package) graphical
		controls (highlighted by a blue box) are available for usage. The most useful might be the camera that allows
		one to download a PNG for the graph. If one hovers over a Plotly control icon it will show its name. Note that
		using some of the other controls (zoom, pan, etc.) may cause
		unexpected behavior as OED is also using those features.</p>
	<p><img alt="Plotly controls" src="./images/plotlyControls.png"></p>

	<h3 id="colors">Colors of lines</h3>
	<p>The color of lines is always the same for a given meter or group. This means everyone sees the same color
		for a
		given meter or group whenever it is graphed. The line colors are chosen to try to provide contrast
		between
		different lines. They are also designed to
		give some differentiation between meters and groups when possible. OED tries to show meters in lighter colors
		and
		groups in darker colors. This is not guaranteed as colors are reused between groups and meters if the number
		in
		either category becomes large. OED also tries to give a unique color to each line but that may not
		happen when
		the number of meters and groups is large. Note both of these depend on the number of meters and groups
		at the
		OED site and not the number being shown. Finally, a given meter or group will have the same color on all
		graphics except compare.</p>

	<h3>When meters/groups have different time ranges of data</h3>
	<p>If the meters included in a group have data for different times then the group will only represent the data that
		is
		available. Suppose the "Great Dorm 1st Floor Electric" meter goes from August 2019 to October 2022 as it does in
		the
		examples on most help pages. Now suppose the "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" meter had data from July 2020 to
		August
		2023 which is different from the time range on most help pages. As seen in the following figure, the lines for
		these
		two meters do not span the same time ranges.</p>
	<p><img alt="line graphic of two meters with substantially different time ranges"
			src="./images/lineDifferentTimes.png">
	<p>As shown in the next figure, the group "Great Dorm Electric Vary" contains these two meters is graphed.</p>
	<p><img alt="line graphic of two meters with substantially different time ranges"
			src="./images/lineDifferentTimesGroup.png">
	<p>As can be seen, July 2020 to October 2022 shows the group looking as the usual sum of the two meters. However,
		August 2019 to June 2020 there is only the value of the "Great Dorm 1st Floor Electric" meter so the meter and
		group lines completely overlap. This occurs
		because
		there is no data for the "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" meter so nothing from that meter is included in the
		aggregation in the group for
		this time range. A similar situation occurs from November 2022 to August 2023 because the meter "Great Dorm 1st
		Floor Electric" does not have any values. For efficiency reasons, OED does not detect when meters are missing
		data when graphing data. This can happen for much briefer periods of time in the middle of the line graphic if
		the meter does not collect
		data for a short time frame. The gaps in meter values can sometimes be seen on either the line or bar graphic of
		that meter. These
		cases are generally unusual and are being noted for completeness sake.</p>
	<p>The time frame (days) shown on the x-axis will be the maximum time for all all meters and groups. If different
		meters and groups have data for different time ranges then some lines will not span the entire length of the
		x-axis. This is seen in the figure above.</p>

	<h3 id="redrawDetails">Why do I need to Redraw and Restore?</h3>
	<p>OED is designed to be fast on any reasonable device. When one is zooming and scrolling within a line
		graphic,
		the work is all done in one's web browser so it will have a very fast response rate. If OED recalculated
		the
		points shown as one zoomed/scrolled then it would be substantially slower, esp. if it needed to access
		the
		site's server to get new
		data. OED could try to determine when one is done zooming/scrolling and then recalculate the points but
		it is
		very difficult to determine when that has happened given users often pause during these operations.
		Thus, to be
		fast and allow one to get high quality line graphs, OED needs one to let it know when one is done and
		needs the
		points displayed to be reset. The "Redraw" button is how one does that. One can also tell OED when one wants
		to go
		back to the original graphic via the "Restore" button. This allows one to see all the data and/or
		zoom/scroll to
		other areas of the graph.</p>

	<h3 id="averaging">Why doesn't OED show all the meter/group data?</h3>
	<p>Meters often get a new data point every 15 to 60 minutes and groups either do hour or day points. This means
		a given
		meter or group can have a lot of data points. For example, a meter reading every 20 minutes for a year
		has over
		26,000 data points. OED refers to these points as the original meter data. There would be two
		main issues
		in showing all the meter data. First, it would be
		significantly slower. All that data needs to be located in the OED database and then transferred across
		the
		network to one's device. If one is on a mobile device one may be paying to transfer the data. Second,
		one would
		not be able to see all the points even if OED tried to graph them. Screen resolutions are in the
		hundreds to
		thousands of pixels (a single point on the screen) and the line graphics only get a subset of those
		pixels. That
		means OED cannot show more than hundreds to a few thousand points (if one has an HD screen). A massive
		number
		of points would be lost in viewing. Thus, OED averages the data on the site server to reduce the number
		of
		points it sends to one's web browser for graphing. Thus, a point is often the average energy usage across that
		time.
		Typically it averages across a day of data to be
		highly
		responsive over longer time frames. If one has limited data points for day averages then it will use smaller
		time intervals
		between
		points and will go to the original meter data when the number is small enough. This is still fast since
		the
		number of points to get is small and the number transmitted is also small. These details
		are
		generally not important except to know that one is often looking at averaged data. Zooming in to
		a
		smaller time frame and redrawing or downloading the raw meter data for a graph are ways to see the
		original
		meter data.</p>

	<h3 id="datetimeFormat">Format of dates and times</h3>
	<p>OED uses a software system that tries to properly use one's currently <a href"./language.html">chosen language of
			display</a> to determine how to
		display dates and times. For example, in English it would show MM DD, YYYY (e.g., January 1, 2020) whereas in
		Spanish it would show DD de MM de YYYY (e.g., 1 de enero de 2020). What this means is the date and time format
		one sees may vary from what is shown in the help pages. It should be more appropriate for one's chosen language.
