	<h1>Group Viewing (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>Groups aggregate data as explained on the <a href="graphingGroups.html">group graphing</a> help page. To
		understand what data is included in a group, the groups page is available.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Click on the "Groups" page choice (see <a href="pageChoices.html">Page Choices</a> for information on doing
		this). Once done, you will see what is in the next figure (for this demo site).</p>
	<p><img alt="groups page" src="./images/groupsPage.png"></p>

	<p>This page gives an overview of all the groups that includes the name and the default graphing unit. For example,
		the "Campus All" group has a default graphic unit of "ton of CO<sub>2</sub>".</p>
	<p id="groupDetails">If you click on The "Group Details" button for any group then additional information is shown
		for that group. For
		example, the result of clicking the "Group Details" button for the group "Campus Electric" is shown in the
		following figure:</p>
	<p><img alt="Group details for Campus Electric" src="./images/groupDetails.png"></p>
	<p>The popup gives the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Group Name. The same name as was shown on the overview page.</li>
		<li>Default Graphic Unit. The same unit as was shown on the overview page.</li>
		<li>Child Meters. A list of all the meters that are included in this group. In this example it includes
			"Dining Hall Electric", "Library Electric" and "Theater Electric".</li>
		<li>Child Groups. A list of all the groups that are included in this group. In this example it includes
			"Great Dorm Electric".</li>
		<li>All Meters. A list of unique meters that are in this group from the child meters and groups. This means
			that
			the meters from the "Child Groups" are explicitly listed. In this example it includes "Dining Hall
			Electric", "Great
			Dorm 1st Floor Electric", "Great Dorms 2nd Floor Electric", "Library Electric" and "Theater Electric" where
			"Great
			Dorm 1st Floor Electric" and "Great Dorms 2nd Floor Electric" are from the group "Great Dorm Electric".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Clicking the "Close" button will take you back to the overview page for groups.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>If a group includes a meter that is not visible to one visiting the site then that will be indicated by replacing
		all hidden meters with "At least one meter is not visible to you" at the bottom of the list. In the previous
		example, if the "Dining Hall Electric" meter is not visible then the details popup would have
		shown the following:</p>
		<p><img alt="Group details for Campus Electric with hidden meter" src="./images/groupDetailsHiddenMeter.png"></p>
		<p>Similarly for groups that are not visible, you will see the message "At least one group is not visible to you".
		</p>
		<p>Admins can see other details about groups as explained on the <a href="adminGroupViewing.html">admin groups</a>
			help page.</p>
