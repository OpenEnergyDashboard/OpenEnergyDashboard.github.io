	<p>The page where you can view OED graphics is considered the home page. There are several ways to get there.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>The following figure shows two ways to get to the home page highlighted in blue boxes. In the top right, corner one can
		click the "Graph" choice to get to the home page. As shown in the figure, if you are already on the home page then this is
		shown grayed out and will have no action. Another way is to click the OED light bulb logo in the top, left corner
		of a page. Clicking the logo when you are already on the home page has no effect.</p>
