	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>This page describes how to add MAMAC meters to OED so they will be read regularly.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Either by <a href="adminMeterCreating.html">admin meters creation web page</a> or via a <a
			href="adminMetersImport.html">CSV meter upload</a>, add a new meter that has the following attributes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>One needs the IP address of the desired MAMAC meter that is the location address where the meter can be
			reached. One should be able to go to this address in a web browser and see the landing page for the meter.
			For this example the IP address of 111.22.33.1 will be used. Use http://111.22.33.1/sm101.xml as the meter
			URL.
		</li>
		<li>Set the meter Type to "MAMAC" (without quotes).</li>
		<li>Set the Reading Frequency to 01:00:00 for one hour.</li>
		<li>Set update to true if you want OED to regularly get this meter data.</li>
		<li>Set Displayable, Unit and Default Graphic Unit to the needed/desired values.</li>
		<li>The other meter values are standard ones that you want for this meter and can be left as the default values
			if desired.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Set up the hourly cron job to update MAMAC meters' data on OED if update is true and you want MAMAC meters to
		update. This only needs to be done once on the server,
		generally by an IT person. This mirrors similar steps in the <a href="adminInstallation.html">site installation
			directions</a>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><code>cp src/scripts/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash /etc/cron.hourly/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash</code>
		</li>
		<li>Edit /etc/cron.hourly/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash to make the necessary modifications to
			the
			script. See the script for more detail.</li>
		<li>Do: <code>chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash</code> to make the script
			executable.</li>
		<li>If you want to immediately run the update on meters without waiting for the hourly script
			one does: <code>docker compose exec web npm run updateMamacMeters</code></li>
		<li>Note that you will not be able to graph the newly acquired meter data until the daily
			aggregation (described on the installation page linked above) is run or you manually refresh the
			readings by doing:
			<code>docker compose exec web npm run refreshAllReadingViews</code>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>Note that OED no longer has access to MAMAC meters so the code should work but report any issues.</p>
