	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>Groups aggregate data as explained on the <a href="graphingGroups.html">group graphing</a> help page. To
		understand what data is included in a group, the groups page is available.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Click on the "Groups" page choice (see <a href="pageChoices.html">Page Choices</a> for information on doing
		this). Once done, you will see what is in the next figure (for this demo site).</p>
	<img alt="groups page" src="../images/OEDGroupsPage.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

	<p>"Group 1 & 2" is highlighted which means its contents are being shown. The "Child Meters:" box has "Meter 1" and
		"Meter 2" which indicates this group includes those two meters. The "Child Groups:" box is empty indicating that
		no groups are included. Overall, this means graphing "Group 1 & 2" would show the sum of "Meter 1" and "Meter 2".
	</p>
	<p>If you click on "Group 1 & 2 & 7 & 8" in the "View Groups" box (becomes highlighted in blue) then you will see the following.</p>
	<img alt="Group 1 & 2 & 7 & 8" src="../images/OEDGroupsPageTwo.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
<p>The "Child Meters:" box has "Meter 1" and
	"Meter 2" which indicates this group includes those two meters. The "Child Groups:" box has "Group 7 & 8" indicating that
	this group includes that group. To determine the meters involved, click on "Group 7 & 8" in the "View Groups:" box (becomes highlighted in blue) and then you will see the following.</p>
	<img alt="Group 7 & 8" src="../images/OEDGroupsPageThree.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The "Child Meters:" box has "Meter 7" and
		"Meter 8" which indicates this group includes those two meters. The "Child Groups:" box is empty indicating that
		no groups are included. Overall, this means graphing "Group 1 & 2 & 7 & 8" would show the sum of "Meter 1", "Meter 2", "Meter 7" and "Meter 8".</p>
