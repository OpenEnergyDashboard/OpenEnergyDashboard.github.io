    <h1>Admin Meter Import (Help)</h1>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>This page describes the process of importing meters into OED via a CSV file. See the <a
            href="adminCsvImport.html">general CSV import</a> page for an overview and information common to all CSV
        imports.</p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>The information needed to upload meters is the same whether done via the web page or direct file upload. The web
        page looks as follows:</p>
    <img alt="admin CSV meter page" src="./images/OEDAdminMeterCSV.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
    <p></p>

    <h3>Required and optional information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The user name and password is required in the direct file upload as described on the <a
                href="adminCsvImport.html">general CSV import</a> page. It is automatically provided on the web page
            upload since you are logged in.</li>
        <li><i>CSV file ("Choose File" button on web page; <code>csvFile</code> parameter on direct file upload)</i>:
            This gives the location of the CSV file containing the meter information. On the web page it is via a file
            picker popup. See below on the file format.</li>
        <li><i>Is CSV file in gzip format ("Gzip" checked if true on web page; <code>gzip</code> parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: Note this is the Gnu zip format and not a standard .zip file format. The default value
            is true. Note that gzip files are smaller in size for upload and also have internal validation to protect
            against corruption so they are preferred.</li>
        <li><i>Does CSV have a header row ("Header Row" checked if true on web page; <code>headerRow</code> parameter on
                direct file upload)</i>: Is the first row of the CSV file header information and not an actual meter
            (see below for format). The default value is false.</li>
        <li><i>Is this an update ("Update" checked if true on web page; <code>update</code> parameter on direct file
                upload)</i>: Each row is new information for the meter so it will be update with any provided values and
            others are left as currently set. The default value is false.</li>
        <li><i>Meter name ("Meter name" input box on web page; <code>meterName</code> parameter on direct file
                upload)</i>: This is only used if you want to change the name of a meter (not identifier). The meter
            name provided is used as the name to update and the meter name value in the CSV is used as the new name.
            Note you can only update a single meter name at a time meaning that the CSV can only have one row of meter
            information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Meter CSV file format</h3>
    <p>If the file has a header row then it should be:<br>
        name,ipaddress,enabled,displayable,type,timezone,gps,identifier,note,area,cumulative,reset,reset start,reset
        end,gap,variation,duplicates,timesort,end only,reading,start time,end time<br>
        More information on the first set of columns/values are described on the <a href="adminMeterViewing.html">admin
            meter viewing</a>
        page and the later ones are the meter defaults for reading input and described on the <a
            href="adminReadingsImport.html">admin reading import</a> page.<br>
        Each following line should contain the values for one meter. Most values can be skipped where the default value
        for OED will be used. A brief description of each value is in the following table:

    <h3>Sample file</h3>
    <p>Below are the lines for a CSV meter import file with a header row. It will import two meters (Meter 1 and Meter
        2) where the meters are not enabled but are displayable. Please note that "1.2, -3.4" is a pair of values
        separated by a comma that would be in a single column of the CSV file and input without the quotes, i.e., 1.2,
        -3.4. The quotes are added when such a CSV is saved to make it clear that the comma is not a new column. Most
        values that are optional and unspecified so the
        default values are used. This <a href="files/meters.csv" download>meters.csv</a> was loaded
        using the curl command of:<br>
        <code>curl https://myoedserver.come:3000/api/csv/meters -X POST -F 'headerRow=true' -F 'gzip=false' -F 'email=csvuser@myorg.com' -F 'password=csvuserpassword' -F 'csvfile=@meters.csv'</code><br>
        assuming the shown URL, user email and password. (See <a href="adminReadingsImport.html#sampleFiles">admin
            reading sample files</a> for more information on URL, email and password.) You need to reload the OED web
        page so your browser is aware of the new meters but you will get an empty graphic if used since they don't have
        any data.
    </p>

    <h3>Return messages</h3>
    <p>What follows are the common messages returned from a meter upload along with their meaning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe41
            seems to exist when inserting new meters and got DB error of: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
            "meters_name_key"</code><br>
            This normally happens when the name (or similarly identifier) of the meter already exists. It may be the
            case that you wanted to update this meter but did not specify this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe42
            does not seem to exist with update for meters and got DB error of: No data returned from the query.</code><br>
            Request indicated to update meter(s) but at least one did not exist. All meters must exist on update.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h1&gt;Successfully inserted the meters.&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to
            upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name provided (pipe40) in request with update for meters but
            more than one meter in CSV so not processing</code><br>
            When you want to change a meter name you specify the name in the request as well as the CSV file. It then
            uses the name in the request to find the meter and the value in the CSV as the new meter name. However, you
            can only have a single meter in the CSV file for this to work. This indicates more than one meter was
            provided.
        </li>
        <li>You can get a variety of error messages if the gzip is improperly set. These include "TypeError", "invalid
            message format" and others. This is because OED is incorrectly reading the CSV file and receives garbled
            information.</li>
