title: OED production install
---
<div>
    <h1>Production Install Output</h1>
    <p>When you install OED for production you will get output similar to what is below (assuming this is the first time
        you are running <code>docker compose up</code>). Please note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This output was created on 13 Oct 2021 on RHEL 7 system using OED v0.6.0. The exact output will vary with
            machine type and changes to
            OED.</li>
        <li>There are often colors in the output but that is not shown.</li>
        <li>Items with // at the start were added after the fact to give information at the point it will occur in the oupt.</li>
        <li>The warning:<br>
            WARNING: could not open statistics file "pg_stat_tmp/global.stat": Operation not permitted<br>
            may or may not show up. It also shows up at other times. The complete answer is not known but it appears to
            be a transient error in PostgreSQL writing log information. It has never caused any problems. On rarer
            occasions it involves another PostgreSQL file.</li>
    </ul>
