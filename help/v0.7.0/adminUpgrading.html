	<h1>OED Upgrades</h1>

	<p>To upgrade the app:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The commands are run in the terminal and it assumes you understand basics of installing OED.
			See the <a href="adminInstallation.html">OED installation page</a> for further information.</li>
		<li>You probably want to know your current version of OED and the version you want to upgrade to. The current
			version of OED is shown at the bottom of each OED website page from your site. Simply go to the URL for your
			site and see what version you have. If you are running v0.6.0 or earlier then the OED version is not on the
			website pages. Then, the OED version is also listed in the <code>package.json</code> file in
			the root directory of OED. All the officially released and tagged versions is given on the <a
				href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer">OED GitHub
				release page</a>. You probably want the most recent version but certainly one that is later than what
			you currently have (OED cannot migrate to a previous version and can only upgrade).</li>
		<li>Go to the root directory where you have OED installed. It will have the README.md and other files.</li>
		<li>The following steps should not cause any loss of data. However, it is always good to be careful. Thus, you
			should backup the database with:
			<code>docker compose exec database pg_dump -U oed > dump_$(date +%Y-%m-%d"_"%H_%M_%S.sql)</code>. It will
			create a file name starting with <code>dump_</code>, then have the date & time and finally have the
			<code>.sql</code> file extension. This file should have the needed commands to recreate the database if
			something should go wrong. You can delete this file once you are sure the upgrade was completely successful
			if you want to save disk space. You can contact the OED project if you need to restore the database due to
			issues.
		</li>
		<li>Stop the OED app from running using: <code>systemctl stop oed.service</code>. This assumes you named the
			service oed.service as is the default in the installation directions. You can check the status of the
			service with <code>systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -i oed</code> where it will not be listed if
			it is stopped. Note this means that the OED
			website/service is no longer available. It will not be permanently available again until you restart the OED
			service at the
			end of this process.</li>
		<li>Store your local config changes with: <code>git stash</code></li>
		<li>Make sure you have the latest git information on the tagged version that were created after your last
			installation with: <code>git fetch --tags</code>.</li>
		<li>Update the code to the desired tagged version with: <code>git checkout &lt;tag_name&gt;</code> where you
			replace &lt;tag_name&gt; with the tagged version you want. For example, to go to v0.7.0 use
			<code>git checkout v0.7.0</code>.
		</li>
		<li>Put back your local changes with: <code>git stash pop</code>. You will see messages including about
			<code>Changes not staged for commit:</code>. This is okay since you are not going to commit these changes
			back to the OED repository (you are actually in a detached head git state). It is unlikely that git cannot
			put back your local changes. If you get merge warnings then see if the named file has lines with multiple
			"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" in a row. If so, then there were merge conflicts. You can try to
			edit the
			file to decide which of the listed lines you need. You are also encouraged to contact the OED project for
			help with this situation.
		</li>
		<li>You now need to upgrade the OED system with:
			<code>docker compose run --rm web src/scripts/updateOED.sh</code>. This will reinstall the node packages
			because there are usually changes, update the database for the new version of OED and then build the new
			application. When you see a line similar to
			<code>[at-loader] Using typescript@3.5.3 from typescript and "tsconfig.json" from /usr/src/app/tsconfig.json.</code>
			in the terminal, OED will be doing the install and may take a while to complete without showing any output.
		</li>
		<li>Though not technically necessary, it isn't a bad idea to manually bring up OED with:
			<code>docker compose up</code>. This is the same step as the original build from
			the first OED installation and can take a little while. See the <a href="adminInstallation.html">OED
				installation page</a> for further information. You should then be able to access OED via a web browser
			to see it is running properly and has all the data and settings you had before the upgrade. Doing it outside
			the Unix service makes it easier to see any issues during the build steps. Once you complete this step then
			do "^c" in the terminal where you did the <code>docker compose up</code> to shut down OED. Be a little
			patient since doing a second "^c" will cause a rapid stop of docker without the normal cleanup.
		</li>
		<li>Restart the OED app and service with: <code>systemctl start oed.service</code>.</li>
	</ol>
