	<p>In addition to choosing the type of graphic to see, OED maintains several other pages that give information.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>There are two pages available to general users that are accessed by the buttons in the top, right corner of the web
		browser window (highlighted with a blue
		box in the figure)</p>
	<img alt="buttons to navigate OED pages" src="../images/OEDPageChoices.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The page options are given next with a brief description. The provided link goes to another help page with
		extensive information on each page.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="meterViewing.html">Meters</a>. This shows details on each meter including the name and
			status.</li>
		<li><a href="groupViewing.html">Groups</a>. This shows detail on each group to see what meters and groups
			are included.</li>
		<li>The "Log in" button is for those with a user name and password to access special parts of the site. It is
			not used by a general user.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>Additional information available on the meter and group pages along with other pages for admins is given in the
		<a href="admin.html">admin help page</a>.</p>
