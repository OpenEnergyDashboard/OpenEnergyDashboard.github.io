	<h1>Admin Group Viewing (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user. </p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>If you are logged in as an admin and visit the "Groups" page then you can see everything a regular usage can see
		as shown on the <a href="groupViewing.html">group viewing page</a> as well as the ability to edit groups. This
		is shown in the figure below. For general information, see the <a href="graphingGroups.html">graphing groups
			page</a>.

	</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Click the "Create a group" button (highlighted with a blue box in the
		next figure). This will allow you to make a new group and take you to the appropriate page.</p>
	<img alt="admin create group button" src="../images/OEDAdminCreateGroupButton.png"
		style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>Use the name field to give this group a unique
		name that will make
		sense to users. Use the "Select Meters:" and "Select Groups" dropdown menus as you would on any page to select
		the meters and groups to include within the new group. The next figure shows what creating a group named "Group
		1 & 2 & 7 & 8" that includes Meter 1, Meter 2 and Group 7 & 8 would look like.

			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>When you are done, click the "Create a group" button. If
		you want stop the process, click the "Cancel" button. Either way you will be returned to the groups page. Once
		you create a new group, it will show up in the list on the group page. This group is highlighted in the next
		figure (by clicking on it) to see that the group contains the meters and group expected.</p>
	<img alt="admin group viewing page of new group created" src="../images/OEDAdminViewCreatedGroup.png"
		style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>If you click the "Edit a group" button next to the "Create a group" button then you are able to edit the group
		highlighted in the list (in this case the new group we just created). This takes you to another page. Next the
		"Unused Meters:" dropdown menu was used to select Meter C and Meter D. The "Unused Groups:" dropdown
		menu was used to select Group A & B. Note that both of these menus do not include any meters or groups already
		included in this group or just selected. The screen looks as in the figure below.</p>
	<img alt="admin group edit page" src="../images/OEDAdminEditGroup.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>Now you can click the left arrow on the meter line to add the two
		meters selected. The same process on the group line to add the one group selected. The next figure shows the
		result where the "Child Meters": dropdown menu was used to see that there are now four meters in this group
		(original two plus two just added). Note it probably would have been a good idea to change the name of this
		group to reflect its new members. This could have been done on the edit page.</p>
	<img alt="admin group edit page" src="../images/OEDAdminEditedGroup.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p> If you click the "Submit changes" button then the updated group will be
		saved. If you click the "Cancel" button then the changes will be discarded.</p>
	<p>You can remove meters and/or groups from this group by selecting the "Child Meters:" or "Child Groups:" and
		clicking the right arrow. This is very similar but the reverse of the process above.</p>
	<p>If you want to completely remove this group then click the "Delete Group" button.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>Note that when you edit a group that is included in another group, the changes to the group impact the other
		group as well.</p>
	<p>Groups will have features similar to meters in the near future and admins will be able to edit them similar to
		meters.</p>
