	<h1>OED Graph Type (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>OED offers multiple types of graphics so you can engage with the data in different ways. The selection of meters
		and groups remains as you change graphic pages. Also, to make it easier to use multiple graphics, the color of a
		meter or group remains the same on the line, bar and map graphic. Compare graphics use the same two colors for
		previous/current time period for all meters/groups.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>There are four types of graphics that each reside on a different page of OED. You can select the desired graphic
		by clicking one the choices from those available (highlighted by the blue box) in the following figure:</p>
	<img alt="choosing graphic options" src="./images/OEDGraphicChoices.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The graphics options are given next with a brief description. The provided link goes to another help page with
		extensive information on each graphic page.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="lineGraphic.html">Line Graphic</a>. In this representation, each meter or group is represented by a
			line graph of usage versus time. There are options to control the time frame shown and to scroll through
			time.</li>
		<li><a href="barGraphic.html">Bar Graphic</a>. In this representation, each meter or group is represented by a
			bar graph of usage versus time. There are options to control the time frame shown in each bar and the type
			of bars used.</li>
		<li><a href="compareGraphic.html">Compare Graphic</a>. In this representation, each meter or group is
			represented
			in an individual bar graph that shows usage during the current period versus the same period immediately
			before. For example, usage of this week versus last week. There are options to control the period compared
			and order in which the bar graphs are shown.</li>
		<li><a href="mapGraphic.html">Map Graphic</a>. In this representation, each meter or group is represented by a
			circle on a map where the size of the circle indicates the usage. This graphic is designed to visually show
			how usage varies across areas on the map.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>By default, OED will display the line graphic page when it starts. The site administrator can change this to be
		any of the graph types. The user can choose any type as described above.</p>
