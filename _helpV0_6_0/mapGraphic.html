		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The map graphic gives a spacial representation of energy usage. Typically a simplified map of buildings and
			any
			important landmarks is used as the image for a map. A circle is placed on the map for each graphed item
			where
			the size of the circle represents its usage. An OED site can have as many maps as it wishes. To get this
			graphic, you click the "Map" choice (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure). This is a simple map
			with
			a few buildings
			where the usage is given for "Play Place" and "Theater". As the size of the circles show, the "Theater" used
			significantly more energy than "Play Place". In the following figure, Meter 7 is for "Play Place" and Meter
			8 is
			for "Theater". This is consistent with what is shown in <a href="../compareGraphic/">compare graphic</a>
			help page where the same meters are used and Meter 8 is shown to use a lot more energy.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>When you go to the map page, you first need to select the map you want to use. You do this by clicking the
			dropdown menu for "Maps:" and clicking the one you want (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure).
			This
			is very similar to what you do for a "Meter:" or "Group:". Even if there is only one map you need to select
			it
			(as in the following figure). Once you click on a map, it will appear in the graphic. If you already have
			meters
			selected that can be shown on the map then they will immediately appear. (See below for more on selecting
			meters.)</p>
		<img alt="selecting map" src="../images/OEDMapSelection.png">
		<p>You select the <a href="../graphingMeters/">meters</a> to graph
			in the usual way. (See <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> below about graphing groups.) OED will display
			each meter as an individual circle as shown in the figure above. In some cases the meter cannot be placed on
			the
			graph. This happens when its GPS coordinates do not lie within the map. Note that a meter without GPS
			coordinates provided by the admin of the site can never be placed on any map. To let the user know when a
			meter
			cannot be placed on the current map, its name is grayed out. These meters cannot be selected. In the
			following
			figure, Meters 1, 2 and A are
			grayed out (highlighted with blue boxes) since they cannot be shown on the map. Meters 7 and 8 look normal
			since
			they can be shown on the map and selected.</p>
		<img alt="grayed out meters that cannot be shown on map" src="../images/OEDMapGrayedMeters.png">
		<p>If you selected Meter 7 and Meter 8 then you would see the graphic at the top of this page.</p>
		<p>If a site has multiple maps that lie in different geographical locations, then a meter grayed out on one map
			might be displayable on another. Also, if you are on a different graphic type and are displaying a meter
			that
			cannot be shown on the map then it will not appear on the map and be grayed out on the "Meters:" list. If
			you
			return to another graphic, the meter will appear again since it can be shown.</p>

		<h3>Map circle colors</h3>
		<p>OED consistently uses the same color for a meter/group across all graphic representations. The map graph may
			seem
			to have a lighter shade of color than the other graphics. This is due to making the circle partly
			transparent so
			you can see the underlying map image. If you look at the color the rectangle that pops up when you hover on
			the
			graph you will see it is the same as the color used for this item in other graphics.</p>

		<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
		<p>Maps are a new and complex feature added in version 0.7. It was designed to show what they can do and allow
			people to begin to incorporate them into their sites. There are several current limitations on maps that
			should
			be removed shortly.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Groups. At the current time you cannot place a group on a map. They are not grayed out on the "Groups:"
				dropdown. Selecting a group will not show it on the map but it will be listed as a selected group. As a
				result, it will show up on other graphic pages.</li>
			<li>The circle represents the average usage over the last 4 weeks bar shown in the bar graphic for this
				meter.
				This means if you change the date range on the line graphic, the bar graphic changes to those dates and
				the
				map graphic also changes the circle size. In the future we will allow other time
				ranges (probably similar to bar graphs).</li>
			<li>Clicking the button to get the map graphic. Depending on the size of your screen, you may not see the
				button
				to select the map graphic when the current graphic is too large. You can normally get around this by
				clicking the "Bar" graphic button to see the "Map" graphic button. This works because the bar graphic is
				normally smaller than other graphics. If this does not work, you can deselect the chosen meters/groups
				to
				make graphics smaller to get the the "Map" button. We will likely fix this by making the graphic
				selection
				be a dropdown menu similar to Groups and Meters.</li>
			<li>Circle size. While the circle size represents the average usage, its overall size is not yet optimized.
				This
				means it might be too large and extend well beyond the item it represents on the map.</li>
