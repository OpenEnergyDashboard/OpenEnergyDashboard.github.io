<h2>Our logo and name</h2>

<p>The logo was designed by an early student code developer who was also studying art. Its design was the result of
    discussions among the early student developers. The light bulb represents energy usage as well as light in the
    sense of hope. The somewhat circular shell of the light bulb represents the "O" in OED. The "ED" in the
    center of the light bulb is the rest of our project initials. Early developers referred to the project as "Eddy"
    due to the "ED" in the logo.</p>

<p>The project debated early on whether to have "Energy" in the name. We always planned that the dashboard could
    collect and display any resource (water, recycling, etc.). However, we chose to use Open Energy Dashboard since
    the term energy was so
    commonly used in this area and our initial versions of the dashboard would focus on electricity (as a
    demonstration).</p>

<h2>A little history</h2>
<p>OED began in the fall of 2016 and was based at Beloit College. Its first public release was in March of 2017. OED
    became a fully independent project around 2018.</p>
