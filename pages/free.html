<p>OED depends on the freely given contributions from several groups. The primary one is those that develop the code
    base. These have mostly been students who do it because they believe in our humanitarian efforts for
    sustainability and also to get a valuable experience by working with a real project. The other large group is
    all
    actual or potential users of the dashboard. These include sustainability people, users of the dashboard, energy
    managers, etc. They provide direction for the features OED provides and feedback on both early version of
    features as well as on the production version of OED. The OED project has found that our mission and principles
    resonate with all these people and they are willing to generously give their time for the common good. While
    each person might have a certain area or interest in the dashboard, they collectively move the project forward
    as a whole. The end result is a high-quality, free energy dashboard that informs people about usage while also
    freeing up time and money to support other initiates in sustainability. The OED project has found this model to
    be viable and strongly believes it will continue into the future, esp. as more people use OED.</p>
