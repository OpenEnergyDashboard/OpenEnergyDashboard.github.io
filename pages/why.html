<p>OED was founded under the belief that sharing and working together will advance our common goals. Instead of
    producing another energy dashboard targeting a single organization, we decided to make a dashboard that would be
    usable and valuable to a wide range of organizations. We pursued this path because the existing dashboards we
    found were not portable, had limited functionality or were not free. OED is driven by the needs of its end users
    where our goal
    is to take care of the underlying technologies so you can more easily do your important work. OED is an open
    project that
    accepts ideas and contributions from everyone. We are pleased to partner with others to achieve a result that
    benefit both you and others.
