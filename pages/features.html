	<p>
		The OED system has a number of features. This page gives a brief description of the feature along with a link to
		the documentation pages with more information and pictures. The <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}//useAcademic/">academic uses example page</a>
		shows many of these features but focusing on how they might be used. Some people may wish to see a number of
		these features by using
		our <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}//demo/">live demo site</a>.</p>
	<p>OED acquires, permanently stores and analyzes data it receives. While this is important in allowing OED to have
		the features on this page, it is not normally visible to the user and is not discussed here. If you are
		interested in how OED
		does this work then please contact the project.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>OED has two types of items it displays in graphical representations of the data:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/graphingMeters/">Meters</a>. A meter is generally a hardware device that
					provides
					information on usage. For example, it might measure electrical usage or water consumption in a
					building. OED aids the OED administrator in adding new meters and lets you control them via web
					interfaces.</li>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/graphingGroups/">Groups</a>. A group represents the sum of data from other
					meters
					or groups. For example, you could have a group with all the electrical meters for your organization
					to get total electrical usage. This allows sites to combine data however they want. For example, a
					college campus might have groups for each dorm, all dorms, athletic facilities, renewable
					generation,
					academic buildings,
					etc. Since groups can contain groups, you could use the groups for each dorm to get the total
					usage across all dorms rather than having to include all the meters again. The site administrator
					can create any desired group via a web interface so each site can do this without needing external
					help (or paying someone to do it). This is a unique and powerful feature of OED.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/graphType/">Graphical display of data</a>. OED currently provides four unique views
			of the
			data. In each view you can pick any meters or groups you want to include.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/lineGraphic/">Line Graphic</a>. Each meter/group is represented by a
					line graph of usage versus time where you can control the time frame shown. An example is shown in
					the
					next figure where "Great Dorm 1st Floor Electric" and "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" meters and
					"Great Dorm Electric" group that includes these two meters. As such, the group is the sum of the
					values of the two meters at each time point.
					value which can be verified by checking the hover value on each line (the "Great Dorm Electric"
					hover is shown).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="line graphic with two meters and a group of those meters in kWh"
					src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphickWhDaily.png"></p>
			<p>One can choose any compatible <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/graphingUnits/">graphing unit</a> to display the
				data.
				In the following figure, the same data is displayed as cost in U.S. dollars. OED supports virtually any
				unit including CO<sub>2</sub>, weight, volume, temperature, power (kW, etc.) where new units can be
				created by a site. Every graphic support one choosing the desired unit for display.</p>
			<p><img alt="line graphic with two meters and a group of those meters in US $"
					src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphicUSDollarDaily.png"></p>
			<p>OED optimizes the time shown between points on a line graphic. This allows each point to be separate
				along with speeding up graphing requests while minimizing the network traffic. In the previous line
				graphic examples, each point represented the average usage over one day. Since there was about three
				years worth of data (16 August 2019 to 16 October 2022), there are 1157 days with that many points on
				the
				graphic. This is why the hover information shows 12:00:00 PM for each point because that is the middle
				of each day/point. While this is useful, sometimes you want to see more detail. In the following
				figure, the
				rectangles at the bottom of the graphic were dragged to contain July 2021 and the graphic was then
				redrawn. The hover now shows thirty minutes into the hour since that is the middle of that
				point that spans one hour. There are approximately 31 days * 24 hours/day = 744 hourly points in this
				graphic.</p>
			<p><img alt="line graphic with July 2021" src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphicUSDollarHourly.png"></p>
			<p>If you continue to zoom in on days then you will see the original meter readings. In the following
				figure, the dates were modified to be the first 20 days in July. The hover now shows 20 minutes past the
				hour because that meter reads data every 20 minutes (the reading goes from 10 past the hour to 30 past
				the hour on this meter). There are 20 days * 24 hours/day * 3 readings/hour
				= 1440 readings on this graphic.</p>
			<p><img alt="line graphic with early July 2021" src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphicUSDollarRaw.png"></p>
			<p>OED will give the highest quality (shortest time between points) for each meter that it can given the
				date range of the graphic.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/barGraphic/">Bar Graphic</a>. Each meter/group is represented by a
					series of bars over the total time chosen showing the total usage over the chosen number of days for
					each
					bar. An example of four weeks is shown in the next figure for the same meters/group for the line
					graphic. It is for kWh where the date range selected was for all of 2021 so there are 52 weeks / 4
					weeks/bar = 13 bars. Again the group is the sum of the two meters.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="bar graphic with two meters and a group of those meters for 4 weeks"
					src="{{ site.urlimg }}barGraphickWh4Week.png"></p>
			<p>There are several bar graphic options. One allows for predefined day, week and 4 weeks bars or one can
				select
				between 1 to 365 days if those are not desired. You can also stack the bars rather than having them next
				to each other for each date range shown.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/compareGraphic/">Compare Graphic</a>. Each meter/group is represented by
					its own
					bar group comparing the current usage to the previous usage over day, week or four weeks. OED
					supports sorting the graphs alphabetically and by how much they improved between the current and
					previous time period. Typically this graphic is used to see how usage is changing and to compare
					between different areas of an organization. For example, on a college campus one could run an energy
					competition to see how each dorm is doing in saving energy. The following figure shows the running
					example in kWh comparing the current week to
					the previous week. It is sorted from the meter/group with the least improvement to the one with the
					best improvement. The title of each graphic is colored coded so it is green when using less
					energy was used in the current time vs the past time and red if using more/same. Note the
					scale of the y-axis varies by meter/group but the sum of the bars for the two meters equals the
					group.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="compare graphic with two meters and a group of those meters for 1 week"
					src="{{ site.urlimg }}compareGraphickWhWeek.png"></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/mapGraphic/">Map Graphic</a>. Each meter/group is represented by a
					circle on a map where the size of the circle represents usage per day for the range selected (day,
					week, 4 weeks). This representation is useful in
					getting a visual sense of how much energy different areas (often buildings) of an organization use.
					A site can have as many maps as they wish and maps can overlap (for example, a larger map with the
					entire organization and ones that zoom in on specific areas).
					The site administrator can upload any graphical image of the organization and they use a web
					interface to define GPS coordinates for all meters/groups. This requires no additional software nor
					knowledge of GIS graphing. The following figure shows the electric usage in kWh of four different
					buildings over four weeks. Three of the buildings use meters for the entire building and the forth
					uses a group since each floor of "Great Dorm" has a separate meter. The hover shows the actual value
					that the circle represents.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="map graphic of 4 buildings" src="{{ site.urlimg }}mapGraphickWh4Weeks.png"></p>
		</li>
		<li><a href=" {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/areaNormalization/">Area normalization</a>. Because the area covered by a meter or
			group can vary
			greatly, the absolute usage can be misleading. To help, OED allows for normalizing the usage by the area
			represented. The following figure shows the electrical usage in BTU (showing you can display in any
			energy
			unit because the meters collect this information in kWh). The Theater uses the most electricity then the
			Dining Hall and the least by Great Dorm.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img alt="line graphic of two building electric usage" src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphicBtu.png"></p>
	<p>In the next graphic, the option to "Normalize by Area" is selected. Note the y-axis units are now "BTU / Hour
		/ sq. meters". The area of the the Theater is 10,000 sq. meters, the Dining
		Hall is 1,000 sq. meters and the Great Dorm is 10,000 sq. meters. Thus, when normalized by area, the Theater
		is substantially below the Dining Hall because it is 10 times larger. There is no change between the Theater
		and Great Dorm because they are the same area. Clearly the Theater is either used
		differently or is much more efficient compared to the Dining Hall.</p>
	<p><img alt="line graphic of two building electric usage normalized by area" src="{{ site.urlimg }}lineGraphicBtuArea.png">
	</p>
	<p>One can normalize by either sq. meters or sq. feet independent of the area unit for a meter/group.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href=" {{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/export/">Data Export</a>. You can export the data of the line and bar graphics
			which
			includes all meters and groups for the specified time frame of the graphic. This means you can use OED to
			inspect the data, including its ability to sum data into groups, and if you decide you would like to work on
			that data outside OED you simply click a button. This also gives you the ability to export all meter data
			that resides in OED for a full
			data dump. OED feels you should always have easy access to your data
			from the web pages. After all, it is your data. OED believes in being open in many ways.
		</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/hideOptions/">Hiding Options</a>. OED is designed to work on any reasonable device
			from a
			cell
			phone to large monitor. If you are on a small screen or a monitor that is not interactive, you might want to
			only have the graphics on the screen. You can hide the options normally shown on the page so they are docked
			in the top, left corner where popup menu gives access to all the OED controls that were docked.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/chartLink/">Chart Links</a>. Sometimes you want to post a specific graphic from OED
			so others
			can easily see it. For example, you might want to have a link on your website to let the public easily see
			how you are reducing your energy usage. You also might want to easily get back a graphic that is interesting
			and took time to produce. For any graphic, you can click a button to get a URL that you can either use as a
			link in a website or put into the address bar in your web browser to recreate that graphic. While the same
			graphic is reproduced, you are in a full featured version of OED so you can continue to interact with the
			system as you wish. To support public monitors without interaction, the link has an option to hide the
			menus.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/meterViewing/">Meter</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/groupViewing/">Group</a>
			Viewing. There is
			a page to see details on meters and another for groups. This allows users to see information about the data
			they are graphing. If you are an administrator of the site then you can use these pages to create new groups
			and edit the
			information for a meter or group.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/tooltip/">Tooltip help</a>. OED has help throughout the web pages to give users
			context sensitive help that is linked to the OED documentation web pages.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.helpCurrent }}/admin/">Admin pages</a>. OED believes that a non-IT person should be able to set up
			a site
			and control the site with just a web browser. OED provides web pages to control many aspects including
			meter, group, unit, conversion and map creation and editings, site language, default graphic shown and the
			site name. There are also features to allow admins
			to input new meters and manually add meter data via a CSV file.</li>
		<li>OED has an interface that allows acquisition of data from many sources. At the current time we can
			automatically accept data from <a href="http://www.obvius.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obvius
				AcquiSuite</a>, which can collect
			data from many meter types, <a href="http://mamacsys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAMAC meters</a> and <a
				href="https://www.egauge.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eGauge meters</a>. OED can also accept meter
			data or the creation of new meters via a CSV file either through the admin web pages or the internet.
			The CSV upload allows for loading historical data as well as sending data from other devices where
			the data can be placed in a CSV file. If the current methods for acquiring meter data do not meet your
			needs, you can produce code to have OED accept the new meter format through our API or contact OED to see if
			we will do the necessary modifications.</li>
		<li>Easy site installation via the Docker containerized system. The automated installation process takes care of
			all needed software. It also isolates OED from other software running on your system so it should not impact
			other applications on your server.</li>
		<li>A site can change the default language displayed on all web pages. OED currently supports English, Spanish
			(Latin American variation) and French. (Some newer parts, such as the help system, are awaiting translation
			from English.) The user can also choose
			the preferred language. Any site wishing to add an additional language should contact us.
			Once the list of phrases used is translated, we can easily include them in OED.</li>
		<li>OED has the ability to send the site administrator a regular email to inform them of any issues OED has
			encountered including failures to acquire meter data.</li>
		<li>OED supports sites using HTTPS (encrypted) connections.</li>
		<li>Unlike some energy dashboards, OED is designed to allow users to interact with the data. If the dashboard
			takes significant time to respond then the user will not want to use interactive features. OED has invested
			significant effort in making the system very responsive by sophisticated data management techniques and
			limiting network transfers. Our goal is sub 1 second response times.</li>
		<li>OED is based on modern, free, maintained and reliable software. This means OED will be a viable dashboard
			for many years
			to come while still supporting current and future computers, cell phones, etc.</li>
		<li>OED is constantly maintaining and enhancing our dashboard. We actively encourage any type of user to report
			issues or ideas for enhancements to OED. We are driven by the user community and their input decides the
			directions we go in.</li>
