	<h2>Email contact with the OED project</h2>

	<h2>GitHub</h2>
	<p>OED resides on GitHub, a platform to store all project information and a history of the code. There are several
		areas that might be of interest when trying to contact us.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The OED GitHub site has an <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/issues" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">issue area</a> to view all known issues, to submit a new issue or comment on
			an existing issue. You can search all the issues to see if your concern is already documented and look at
			the conversation to date. An "Open"
			issue means it is not yet resolved and a "Closed" issue means it is resolved. Note that a closed issue may
			not yet be in the version of OED you are running. You can comment on a closed issue or open a new one if you
			feel the concern has not been adequately or correctly addressed.
		</li>
		<li>The OED GitHub site has a <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/discussions" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion area</a>. One is the "User Discussion Area" that allows users to
			make suggestions and have discussions about OED. This contains a thread about features that have been
			proposed, their status and allows your input on these features or others you would want. If you have a
			GitHub account then you can subscribe to an OED Discussion by clicking the button on the right side of any
			discussion page.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Hearing back from OED</h2>
	<p>You should expect to hear back from us about your input and how
		we plan to deal with it. For email we generally contact you directly via email. For input on the GitHub site we
		generally respond by posting on GitHub.</p>
