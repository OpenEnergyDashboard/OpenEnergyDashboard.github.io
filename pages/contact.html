      In addition to seeing all the source code, one can see input an issue.
      The OED GitHub project allows one to view all known issues, to submit a new issue or comment on
      an existing issue. You can search all the issues to see if your concern is already documented and look at
      the conversation to date. An "Open"
      issue means it is not yet resolved and a "Closed" issue means it is resolved. Note that a closed issue may
      not yet be in the version of OED you are running. You can comment on a closed issue or open a new one if you
      feel the concern has not been adequately or correctly addressed.'
