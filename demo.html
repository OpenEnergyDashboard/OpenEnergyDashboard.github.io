    <p><strong>Due to the need to change hosting sites, the OED demo site is not available at this time. We are actively
            working to arrange a new hosting site and make the demo site available. We appreciate your understanding as
            we work on this unexpected situation.</strong></p>

    <p>You may wish to see a live site of OED running to get a feel for how it works. To provide that experience, OED
        has a live demo site. Please note the following when using this site:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A real site would likely have more meters and groups. This site was kept simple to get an easy feel for how
            OED runs.</li>
        <li>The group "Dorm A" is the total usage for "Meter 1" and "Meter 2". The group "Dorm Complex" is the total
            usage for "Meter 3" and "Dorm A" so it has three meters in it. This can be seen by looking at the "Groups"
            page in OED.</li>
        <li>The site is not collecting data so it does not change with time. This is helpful but it does mean the
            "Compare" graphic shows empty graphs since there is no recent data.</li>
        <li>The many admin features cannot be used since this requires a login. If you want to see those features then
            you should <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</li>
    </ul>
