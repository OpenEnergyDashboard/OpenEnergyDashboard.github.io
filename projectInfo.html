	<h1>Open Energy Dashboard Information</h1>

	<h2>Plans</h2>
	<p>The OED project directions are determined by sites, users and the sustainability community. This means that what
		we decide to work on is dependent on what you tell us. The <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/discussions">OED GitHub Discussions</a> contain a User
		Discussion Area. Within this is the "Potential future features of the Open Energy Dashboard" where proposed
		issues are listed where you can comment and/or support a feature along with proposing a new one. If you have a
		GitHub account then you can subscribe to an OED Discussion by clicking the button on the right side of any
		discussion page. You can also <a href="contact.html">contact</a> the project.</p>

	<h2>Issues</h2>
	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/issues">OED GitHub Issues page</a> contains all known
		bugs
		and issues with OED. There you can search to see if something you see is already known. You can also create a
		new issue or comment on an existing issue. An "Open"
		issue means it is not yet resolved and a "Closed" issue means it is resolved. Note that a closed issue may
		not yet be in the version of OED you are running. You can comment on a closed issue or open a new one if you
		feel the concern has not been adequately or correctly addressed. You can also visit the <a
			href="contact.html">contact page</a> for other ways to reach us.</p>

	<h2>Legal licensing</h2>
	<p>
		The OED project is open source under the Mozilla Public License (MPL)
		which is MPL 2.0 as of 2017. This is a legal framework used by many
		projects to guarantee that software will be forever
		available and free to everyone. So, if you want to use OED, rest assured that it is completely free and will
		remain that way forever. The MPL places requirements on anyone
		who makes modifications to the software. While you should read up on
		the details if you want to edit the software (<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/"
			target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPL
			FAQ</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPL
			license</a> and other resources on the web), it does require you to, in
		general, share your work back with the OED project. The idea is
		everyone benefits from the free software and sharing is the best way of enabling this.
