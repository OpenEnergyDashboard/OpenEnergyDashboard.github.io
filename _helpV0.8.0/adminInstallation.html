        <p>This describes the installation of an OED site for production use. If you are a developer, you likely want to
            follow the directions on the <a href="../../developer/gettingStarted.html">getting started</a> page.</p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>OED uses Unix, including Linux, features to work. Mac-OS X is based on Unix and Docker can be installed
            directly
            as
            an application. Windows OS is not based on Unix so other steps are necessary. Given that Windows 10+ is
            generally needed to install OED and the fact that most systems run at least Windows 10, these directions
            assume
            your system is at that level of Windows (and use the OS name Windows 10). If you have Windows 10
            Professional,
            Enterprise or Education, you should be able to directly install Docker via the Hyper-V though it may need to
            be
            enabled (this has not been tested by OED). If you have Windows 10 Home then you can use WSL 2 to enable
            Linux
            and then install Docker. Once you
            have Docker installed and working, you can follow the direction given here since they only depend on
            Docker/docker compose. The beginning of the <a href="../../developer/wslSteps.html">WSL page</a> has details
            on
            WSL and Docker
            installation on Windows 10 Home.</p>
        <p>OED is installed using the Docker containerization tool. This allows it to be
            segregated from the rest of the system, and makes updates easier to perform, since the
            dependencies are all taken care of through the container definitions. Under Docker, OED is installed and
            administered using the <code>docker compose</code> command. (Note more recent versions of Docker have the
            <code>docker compose</code> command so you no longer need <code>docker-compose</code>. If your Docker does
            not
            support this (likely see an error with <code>docker compose</code> of "docker: 'compose' is not a docker
            command.") then you need to install docker-compose and replace all the <code>docker compose</code> commands
            with <code>docker-compose</code>.) You
            will need Docker version 18.06 CE or higher but that should not be an issue if you have any reasonably
            up-to-date version. Some versions of Linux already have Docker or it can be installed. Docker for MacOS is
            an
            app that can easily be installed. For Windows 10 Home you can see the link on the WSL page given in the
            previous
            step. General Docker installation information is available from <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="nofollow">Docker</a>.
        </p>
        <p>It is assumed that your server is set up to respond to web requests (port 80) and that port 3000 is allowed
            (unless you
            change the default OED port). It is also assumed the server can access the internet for the installation.
        </p>
        <p>These directions assume someone with root access to the server where OED is being installed and a working
            knowledge of doing Unix shell commands including editing text files. This is generally someone within the IT
            department of your
            organization.</p>

        <p>This guide requires that you enter some commands into an operating system shell, or
            terminal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On Windows, this is the terminal that connects to the Linux running under WSL.</li>
            <li>On MacOS, you can use Terminal.app (the default), iTerm2, or any other terminal program.</li>
            <li>On Linux, your distribution will provide a terminal; it can generally be opened with
                Ctrl+Shift+T or by searching for "Terminal" in your application menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <p>Follow these steps to install a production (OED site for you institution) site:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Clone the desired OED code from Github. Note if you leave off <code>directory</code> in the next step
                    then the OED code
                    will be placed
                    in the current directory in the subdirectory OED. If you use "." for the <code>directory</code>
                    (just a
                    period without the quotes) then the OED software will be placed directly into the current directory
                    without a subdirectory. You can place the OED software anywhere you want but
                    be sure to be in the desired directory before you begin the clone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want a specific released version of OED (this is most common) then do:
                        <code>git clone --branch &lt;tag_name&gt; https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED.git [directory]</code>.
                        You can find the officially released and tagged versions at the <a
                            href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer">OED
                            GitHub
                            release page</a>. In general, you should take the latest release (at the top of the page).
                        Note
                        that the clone will not include git history (with detached head) but that should not be needed
                        in a
                        production environment. For example, to get release v0.7.0 in the subdirectory OED of the
                        current
                        directory do:
                        <code>git clone --branch v0.7.0 https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED.git</code>.
                        After this you should see the directory OED where you did the clone.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you want the latest version from development then do:
                        <code>git clone https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED.git [directory]</code>. Note this
                        will
                        likely be code that has yet gone through complete testing as done for an official release
                        version
                        but will have the latest OED code base.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>cd into the directory that has the cloned version of OED. This is known as the root directory of OED.
                It has a README.md file and others. What
                follows assumes you are in the root directory of OED (as is the default when you clone).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. Note that for values with an = you should not put spaces before
                    or
                    after the equal sign as is shown in the sample value. The edits are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>POSTGRES_PASSWORD (under <code>services: -&gt; datebase: -&gt; environment:</code>) to a
                        site specific password instead of the <code>pleaseChange</code> that is provided. Keep it
                        secret but you should never need to know this value unless you want to
                        access the PostgreSQL database outside of the docker container. It will be:
                        <code>- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=whateverPasswordYouChoose</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>OED_PRODUCTION (under <code>services: -&gt; web: -&gt; environment:</code>) to
                        <code>yes</code> so it becomes: <code>- OED_PRODUCTION=yes</code>.
                    <li>OED_TOKEN_SECRET (under <code>services: -&gt; web: -&gt; environment:</code>) to a
                        random value instead of the <code>?</code> that is provided. Keep it secret but you should never
                        need to know this value. It will be:
                        <code>- OED_TOKEN_SECRET=whateverTokenYouChoose</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The port (in <code>services: -&gt; web: -&gt; ports:</code>) to a mapping from host to
                        container;
                        e.g.,
                        to host on your computer's port 80, set it to <code>80:3000</code>. This assumes you want to
                        serve
                        OED up on the standard web port. There are multiple lines here and some are commented out (begin
                        with <code>#</code>). Before you edit it should look like:
                        <pre><code>
    ports:
        - "3000:3000" # Should be commented out if you uncomment 80:3000 below.
        - "9229:9229" # Debug port, should be commented out for production
        # For production you might want something like:
        # - "80:3000"
        # and comment out the debug port and 3000:3000 line above
           </code></pre>
                        <p>If you want to have standard web requests (port 80) serve up OED then edit to look like (you
                            comment out the debug port because it is not normally used in production):</p>
                        <pre><code>
    ports:
        # - "3000:3000" # Should be commented out if you uncomment 80:3000 below.
        # - "9229:9229" # Debug port, should be commented out for production
        # For production you might want something like:
        - "80:3000"
        # and comment out the debug port and 3000:3000 line above
                 </code></pre>
                        <p></p>It is possible to use a different port. For example, if you leave the line
                        <code>- "3000:3000"</code> uncommented and comment out <code>- "9229:9229"</code> then OED will
                        server up on port 3000 (where you leave the <code>- "80:3000"</code> line commented out).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>OED_SITE_READING_RATE (under <code>services: -&gt; web: -&gt; environment:</code>) might need to
                        be
                        updated. This represents the typical rate that meters at your site provide data. This impacts
                        when
                        OED switches from daily to hourly to original meter data when doing line graphics. The default
                        value
                        is 00:15:00 meaning the meter data is expected every 15 minutes. If the value is roughly right
                        then
                        there should be no issues. Note you do not change OED_TEST_SITE_READING_RATE as that is used
                        internally for the automated tests in OED. More information is available on the help pages.</li>
                    <li>Later in these directions, it is suggested you set up a cron job to send an email to someone
                        each
                        day with any issues the OED installation encountered. For this to work, OED needs to have access
                        to
                        a mail system (SMTP server) to send the mail. To do this you need to set these environment
                        values
                        under <code>services: -&gt; web: -&gt; environment:</code></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_METHOD gives the way email is sent (SMTP). As the comment says this can be
                            <code>secure-smtp</code> to use your SMTP server or <code>none</code> if you are not going
                            to
                            have OED send mail
                            alerts. OED only supports sending mail via secure channels. Note that the SMTP listed here
                            does
                            not have to relate to the mail recipient. In the
                            end, this usually becomes <code>OED_MAIL_METHOD=secure-smtp</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_SMTP gives the web address of the SMTP server you are using. For example, it could
                            be
                            <code>OED_MAIL_SMTP=smtp.example.com</code> where example.com would become the domain for
                            your
                            organization or you could use <code>OED_MAIL_SMTP=smtp.gmail.com</code> for Google Mail.
                        </li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_SMTP_PORT gives the port number of the SMTP server you are using. For example, it
                            is
                            often <code>OED_MAIL_SMTP_PORT=465</code> for the standard SSL connection port.</li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_IDENT gives the user name on the SMTP server where the mail will be sent. Replace
                            <code>someone@example.com</code> with your user name email.
                        </li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_CREDENTIAL gives the password for the SMTP user in OED_MAIL_IDENT. Replace
                            <code>credential</code> with that password. Note this setup cannot accommodate two factor
                            authentication (2FA) unless you have access to a token for the credential (an app password
                            for
                            mail for Google has been tested and it works).
                        </li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_FROM give the email address that the mail will be from. This is often the same as
                            the
                            OED_MAIL_IDENT so it might be <code>OED_MAIL_FROM=mydomain@example.com</code> where you use
                            the
                            desired email address.</li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_TO gives the email address of who will get the emails. Replace
                            <code>someone@example.com</code> with the desired email. It can be the same as the SMTP
                            email
                            above or something different.
                        </li>
                        <li>OED_MAIL_ORG gives the organization name that will be part of the subject of the email sent.
                            This may be important in recognizing the email, esp. if the person receiving it gets email
                            from
                            multiple OED sites (not common). Replace <code>My Organization Name</code> with whatever
                            name
                            you
                            want.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>For the remaining steps you need to be the superuser/root to have sufficient permission to modify system
                files.
                On some OS setups you can do the install step (next) without being the superuser but it is generally
                safer
                to not to try.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you are in the root OED directory (where the README.md file is located).</li>
            <li>Install OED on the server by doing <code>docker compose up</code>. (On older versions of Docker you must
                do
                <code>docker-compose up</code>.) This will get all the needed software
                including Postgres, all node packages and then installs all the needed software. This can take from
                a minute
                to 10+ minutes depending on the speed of your server. You will see a lot
                of output about installing
                the database (Postgres), getting needed packages (<strong>this can take a while so you may
                    not see output for a while</strong> normally happening right after the " database system is ready to
                accept connections" output line) and starting up the web system. When you see the
                lines:
                <pre>
oed-web-1       | &lt;s&gt; [webpack.Progress] 100% 
oed-web-1       | 
oed-web-1       | ℹ ｢atl｣: Time: 24033ms    
            </pre>
                then OED should be ready to accept web requests, where the actual number of hidden modules will likely
                be
                different. Note is says is is listening on port
                3000 since that is what OED listens on but the ports: changes you made above mean the web requests to
                port
                80 (or whatever you chose) will be sent on to port 3000 for OED. If there was an error in the output
                then
                OED might not be running properly. Please contact the OED project if you have questions where sending
                the
                terminal text is generally very helpful.
                <p>If you quickly get the error
                    <code>Invalid interpolation format for "command" option in service "web": "${install_args:-}"</code>
                    then it is likely you are running an older version of docker-compose (less than version 2). You can
                    fix
                    this error by editing the docker-compose.yml file (as you did above). At the end of the file you
                    will
                    see (Note OED v0.7.0 and earlier does not have the last three lines to deal with older versions of
                    docker
                    compose so you will need to add them during your edits. It also has the reverse proxy line comment
                    that
                    has since been removed.):
                </p>
                <code><pre>
                # Lets docker-compose up work right

                <p>Edit this to be:</p>
                <code><pre>
                # Lets docker-compose up work right

                command: ["bash", "./src/scripts/installOED.sh"]
            </pre></code>
                <p>If you redo the <code>docker compose up</code> then you should now get the expected output described
                    above.</p>
            </li>
            <p>The <a href="./adminInstallOutput.html">typical output of the install</a> is available.</p>
            <li>You can now use a web browser to check that OED is properly serving up web pages. Use the web
                address
                <code>oed.myinstition.org</code> where you replace oed.myinstition.org with the name of the server
                where you installed OED. If all is working properly you will see the main OED page (see <a
                    href="./graphType.html">Graph Type</a> help page for an image of what it will look like). You won't
                be
                able to
                graph any data until you have OED acquire meter data. If you did not do the mapping of 80:3000
                above, then
                OED would be reachable at <code>oed.myinstition.org:3000</code>.
            </li>
            <li>You now need to create an admin user so you can log into OED on the website. To do this you will need a
                second terminal where you go to the root OED directory and are a superuser/root (as you have been). This
                is
                done so you don't have to shut down OED to add the user. Run the script with:
                <code>docker compose run web npm run createUser</code>. The code will prompt you to enter an email
                address
                and password:
                <pre>
# docker compose run web npm run createUser
Starting checkoed_database_1 ... done

> Open-Energy-Dashboard@0.6.0 createUser
> node ./src/server/services/user/createUser.js

Email of user to create: someEmail@yourInstitution.org
Password: passwordYouChoose
[INFO@2021-10-13T21:40:31.853Z] User created or already exists
            </pre>
                where you replace <code>someEmail@yourInstitution.org</code> with any email (it does not have to be an
                active one) and <code>passwordYouChoose</code> with the password you want to use with this email to
                login to
                OED (passwords must be at least 8 characters long). It is important to remember this email & password so
                you
                have access to OED admin features on the web pages. You can run the command
                <code>docker compose run web npm run editUser</code> to change the password if you forget it or you can
                create a new user. Note an OED admin user can create more users on the site so this is normally a
                one-time
                step.
                <p>Note that OED echos what you type so this information will be in the terminal. You shouldn't need
                    this
                    terminal any more so you can close it to hide the information or usually type <code>clear</code> to
                    remove it from what is shown in the terminal.</p>
                <p>You should now log in to make sure this account works. <a href="./admin.html">Logging in</a>
                    directions
                    are available but basically you click the "Log in" button in the top, right of the OED website and
                    then
                    enter the information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Shut down OED. You will soon be setting up OED to run as a service so you want to stop the one running
                in
                the
                terminal. In the terminal where you started OED (with <code>docker compose up</code>),
                do "^c" to shut down OED. Be a little patient since doing a second "^c" will cause a rapid stop of
                docker
                without the normal cleanup.</li>
            <li>In the following steps you need to know the root directory of OED. In the terminal where you are in the
                OED
                root directory do: <code>pwd</code> and the output will tell you the directory path.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Set up the daily cron job to email the OED admin with any issues that occurred in the past day. You
                    are
                    not required to do this but it is a very good idea. It gives someone a daily email of any issue so
                    they
                    are not missed. See above about needed values in docker-compose.yml to support sending emails.

                    want
                    to see the latest meter data quickly then this should be done hourly. Note the update takes a modest
                    amount of CPU and can delay when users see data. If you prefer, you could run the script daily just
                    before running the daily updates. This would mean the new hourly data would only become visible
                    after
                    the day completes.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the root OED directory do (this assumes you do the update every hour):

                    <li>Do: <code>chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/refreshHourlyReadingViewsCron.bash</code> to make the script

                <p>Set up the service so OED runs regularly on your system. There is a chance that your version of
                    Unix
                    requires a modification of these steps. These steps should work on a Red Hat/Centos Unix. The "User"
                    you
                    need to set below is the one assigned to OED, the one you logged in as before becoming
                    superuser/root or
                    (hopefully not) the superuser/root.</p>

                    <li>Do: <code>systemctl enable oed.service</code> to make the service start on server boot.</li>
                    <li>Assuming you want to start OED at this time do: <code>systemctl start oed.service</code>.
                        Stop the
                        app at any time by doing:
                        <code>systemctl stop oed.service</code> but note it will restart on the next reboot unless
                        you
                        disable this service with: <code>systemctl disable oed.service</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>To check the status of the OED service do:
                        <code>systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -i oed</code>. Note
                        that OED needs to reinstall/restart when you start the service again so it will take a little
                        while
                        from the time this lists the service as loaded and active running until it is ready to serve up
                        web
                        pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you want to check this is all set up correctly then restart the server and check it is still
                        serving up web pages (as described above).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Sometimes you want to see the output of OED when it is running as a service. This can be useful during
                the
                install if you want to see why OED did not come up. You do this by:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Get the container ID by using: <code>docker ps -a</code>. The CONTAINER ID will be the one with the
                    IMAGE of ...oed_web (where there may be some name in the ...) for the install/web output and IMAGE
                    of
                    ...oed_database for any database output.</li>
                <li><code>docker logs &lt;CONTAINER ID&gt; | more</code> where you replace &lt;CONTAINER ID&gt; with the
                    one
                    you want from the previous step.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>You will want to get meter data into OED so the site can display data. See the <a
                    href="adminDataAcquisition.html">data acquisition</a> page for more information on doing this.

        <h1>OED upgrades</h1>
        <p>The OED project is regularly improving the code and releasing new versions of OED. To get the latest
            features,
            you will probably want to upgrade OED over time. Information on officially released and tagged versions is
            given
            on the <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer">OED GitHub
                release page</a>. If you see a newer version that you want to upgrade to then consult the directions on
            the
            <a href="adminUpgrading.html">OED Upgrading page</a>.
        </p>

        <h1>Other information</h1>
        <p>Though less likely, you may want to consult:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../../developer/environment.html">Environment variable</a> page about all the OED
                environment
                variables.</li>
            <li><a href="../../developer/npm.html">NPM script</a> page about the available scripts to support the OED
                setup.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is rare that the node/npm installation is not okay in a production environment. The OED installation
            detects
            if the node install already happened (because there is a node_modules directory in the root OED directory)
            and
            skips doing it again to save time. However you can force OED to do the node install by going to the root OED
            directory and deleting the node_modules directory with: <code>rm -rf node_modules/</code>. Make sure OED is
            not
            running (see stopping the service above) before you do this since it will break the application. Redoing the
            OED
            install with <code>docker compose up</code>
            will recreate this directory.</p>
