	<p>The admin unit viewing page allows admin users to see all the units on an OED site. It is accessed
		from
		the <a href="../pageChoices/">"Pages" dropdown menu</a> by clicking "Units" as shown in the following
		figure (highlighted in the blue
		rectangle where "Units" is grayed out since it has already been clicked; There are more units farther down the
		page). This page also allows admins to
		<a href="../adminUnitCreating/">create</a> and <a href="../adminUnitEditing/">edit</a>
		units. Further <a href="../conversionsUnits/">information on units</a> is
		available.

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, each unit has its own card to show information about that unit. The
		cards are sorted from left to right and top to bottom by the unit's identifier.
		Each card contains the following information:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The blue area gives the identifier of the unit.</li>
		<li>Name. The name is whatever the site wants to use internally for the unit and is not displayed to non-admin users.
		</li>
		<li>Type of Unit. This gives the type of the unit of "unit", "meter" or "suffix". More details are given on the
			<a href="../adminMeterCreating/">admin meter creating</a> page.
		</li>
		<li>Unit Represent. This gives what the unit represents of "quantity", "flow" or "raw". More details are given
			on the <a href="../adminMeterCreating/">admin meter creating</a> page.</li>
		<li>Displayable. This controls who can see a unit and graph it. It is "yes" in green if
			everyone can graph with this unit, "admin" in yellow if only admins can graph with this unit and "none" in
			red if no one graph with this unit.</li>
		<li>Preferred Display. This is currently unused but is planned to indicate if this should be a primary unit for
			display to users.</li>
		<li>Sec in Rate. This gives the number of seconds in the unit if a flow unit. It is not used for quantity and
			raw units. More details are given
			on the <a href="../adminMeterCreating/">admin meter creating</a> page.</li>
		<li>Suffix. If blank then this is not a suffix unit. Otherwise, it gives the suffix value. More details are
			given
			on the <a href="../conversionsUnits/#suffix">conversion and units</a> page.</li>
		<li>Note. This may give additional information about the unit supplied when OED created it or from the
			admin. Only the first 30 characters will be shown and any additional characters in the note can be seen by
			clicking the "Edit Unit" button.</li>
		<li>Edit Unit button. Clicking this button allows for <a href="../adminUnitEditing/">editing the values
				associated with this unit</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In addition, there is a "Create a Unit" button near the top of the page that allows for <a
			href="../adminUnitCreating/">creating a new unit</a>.</p>
