        <h1>OED Upgrades Through OED v1.0.0</h1>

        <p>If you are migrating though v1.0.0 then special steps are needed. This is due to the need for a major
            database
            upgrade. You are doing this type of migration if the current version is below v1.0.0 but the new version is
            v1.0.0 or above. This is a onetime process so it is not needed if you are upgrading starting with a version
            at
            or beyond v1.0.0.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The following steps are meant to migrate OED's Postgres version across multiple major versions, specifically
            from
            10.13 to 15.3 when going to OED v1.0.0, with the help of two scripts to automate as much of the process as
            possible. Before starting, make
            sure OED and its Docker containers are running. As with other migration work, be sure to be working in the
            main
            OED directory.</p>

        <p>Since this is a unique step and some sites may have difficulties, you are welcome to reach out to the OED
            project
            to get help in doing this or address any concerns you may have.</p>

        <h2>Getting the scripts</h2>
        <p>You need two scripts from OED v1.0.0 to perform this migration. Unfortunately, they are used before the
            software
            is updated. Use the links for each file to go to the GitHub repository. Place each file in the OED main
            directory by doing <strong>one</strong> of the following (in likely order of what is easiest to hardest to
            do):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use the "download raw file" button to get the file. You will likely need to then move file from wherever
                your
                web browser downloads files to the main OED directory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the "copy raw file" button to get the file. In the terminal/shell in the main OED directory do the
                following:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>cat > restoreDatabase.sh</code></li>
                    <li>Paste the file contents copied from GitHub in the previous step.</li>
                    <li>Enter control-d meaning control and d keys at the same time. This will end the input of the file
                        contents.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                As a last resort, you can create a new directory and clone OED v1.0 into that directory. You should then
                be
                able to copy the files from src/server/migrations/scripts/ into the main directory of OED you are
                upgrading.
                You will not need this clone after this so you can delete this clone.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The links for the two files are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/blob/v1.0.0/src/server/migrations/scripts/dumpDatabase.sh"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dumpDatabase.sh</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/blob/v1.0.0/src/server/migrations/scripts/restoreDatabase.sh"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restoreDatabase.sh</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Running the first script</h2>
        <p>The first script is called <code>dumpDatabase.sh</code> and it should be in the main OED directory after the
            steps above. Run the script in the main OED directory by running the command:<br>
            <code>bash dumpDatabase.sh</code><br>
        </p>

        <p>The script will then run the first steps of the database migration, eventually prompting the user to reset
            the
            passwords for the database users oed and postgres. It will display the passwords that it should be reset to
            based on the environment variables, and the user must enter it in twice and make sure that no error messages
            occur. It is okay to copy the password shown and paste it into the requested password. Afterwards, the
            script
            will create a
            database dump file called <code>script_database_dump.sql</code> in the main OED directory where the script
            was
            run from.
        </p>

        <h2>Shutting down OED</h2>
        <p>The first script requires OED to be running but the second script requires OED to be shut down. Please shut
            down
            OED before running the next script. See the step in the <a href="../adminUpgrading/">admin upgrading
                page</a>
            for details on doing this.</p>

        <h2>Running the second script</h2>

        <p>The second script is called <code>restoreDatabase.sh</code> and it should be in the main OED directory after
            the
            steps above. Run the script in the main OED directory by running the command:<br>
            <code>bash restoreDatabase.sh</code><br>
        </p>

        <p>The second script will remove the postgres version 10.13 database container and bring up a container with
            postgres version 15.3. It will restore the dump to the new database container and bring it back down again,
            leaving OED in a shut down state. This can take a couple of minutes. After script finishes running
            successfully,
            the database migration is complete. If you are asked about
            descending and/or removing a write protected directory (postgres-data) then you should answer 'y' (without
            the
            quotes).

        <h2>Removing files</h2>
        <p>This process created three files that are no longer needed. To keep your software directory clean and to save
            space, it is best to remove them before continuing with a standard upgrade. Do the following in a
            terminal/shell
            in the main OED directory:<br>
            <code>rm dumpDatabase.sh restoreDatabase.sh script_database_dump.sql</code><br>
            Note that not doing this could cause a git merge issue when you do the rest of the upgrade.
        </p>

        <h2>Continuing upgrade</h2>
        <p> At this point you can continue the <a href="../adminUpgrading/">standard upgrade process from the next
                step.</a></p>
