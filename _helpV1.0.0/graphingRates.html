		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		A graphic rate is the time normalization used in the y-axis of most line graphics. The rate menu on the line
		graphic
		page shows the available rates and allows one to select a rate. The default rate is hour.

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>The rate menu on the line graphic page is shown in the following figure (highlighted in blue box). Note
			the "Great Dorm Water" meter has already been selected. The y-axis is graphing in "gallon / Hour" since
			"Hour"
			is the rate. The rate of "Hour" was selected by OED since it is the default rate and a different one was not
			selected.</p>
		<img alt="Graphic rate menu" src="../images/graphicRateMenuWithGallonHour.png">
		<p>The following figure shows the rate menu choices when it is clicked. There are four available rates:
			"Second",
			"Minute", "Hour" and "Day". "Hour" is in darker blue since it is the current choice and "Day" is in lighter
			blue
			since the mouse pointer is over that choice (cannot see mouse pointer in image).</p>
		<img alt="Graphic rate menu" src="./images/graphicRateMenuOverDay.png" width="194">
		<p>If one selects the rate of "Day" then the line graphic is updated to reflect that rate as shown in the next
			figure. The y-axis is now labeled "gallon / Day" to reflect the new rate. The values shown are 24 times
			larger
			than the figure above with a rate of "hour" since a day is 24 times slower rate than an hour so it covers
			more
			time.</p>
		<img alt="Graphic rate menu" src="../images/graphicRateWithGallonDay.png">
		<p>One can select any rate at any time.</p>

		<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
		<p>The units of "kWh" and "kW" (if present at a site) are special in terms of rates. Both will graph as "kW" as
			described in <a href="../graphingUnits/#yAxisUnit">graphic units used</a>. While the name does not imply
			this, watt (W) already has an associated rate since it is
			defined as joules / second. As such, it would be unusual (strange) to normalize watts to another rate. Thus,
			no
			matter what rate you choose, it will not alter the y-axis label or the graphic values when the line graphic
			is
			showing "kW". At the
			current time OED does not stop you from selecting a rate in this case. A future release will not allow rate
			selection for "kW".</p>
		<p>Some units, such as temperature, do not graph as a rate (<a href="../graphingUnits/#axisUnit">see for more
				information</a>). Given this, there is no associated rate so selecting any rate does not change what is
			displayed. As with "kW", just described above, OED plans to disallow rate selection in this case in a future
			release.</p>
