		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The admin unit creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to create a new
			unit on an OED site. It is accessed from
			the <a href="../adminUnitViewing/">admin unit viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
			Unit" button near the top of that page. Further <a href="../conersionsUnits/">information on
				units</a> is available and this page assumes one understands about units.
		</p>
		<img alt="Admin unit creating popup" src="../images/adminUnitCreatingPopup.png" width="594">
		<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="../exampleDescription/">documentation example</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Identifier. This is the "name" of the unit shown when <a href="../graphingMeters/">graphing meters</a>.
				The
				identifier of a unit must be different from any other unit. If no identifier is
				provided then the name provided is automatically used. Note that the identifier is best if it reflects
				what
				it
				represents so it is easy for the user to understand what this unit will do. For a quantity unit that is
				generally easy, e.g., gallons. For a rate unit it should not have the denominator because OED
				automatically
				adds that when graphing because the rate is user selectable. Thus, the identifier might be "gallons
				(flow)""
				but the name could be "gallons per hour" since that is for admin use only.
			</li>
			<li>Name. This is the name of the unit. It is often the same as the identifier but can differ. The name is
				whatever the site wants to use internally for the unit and is not displayed to non-admin
				users. This field will be outlined in red until a name is input as
				is shown in the figure above.</li>
			<li>Type of Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the unit's type. The default choice is
				"unit".
				More details are given
				on the <a href="../conversionsUnits/">information on units</a> page. The result of
				clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin unit types choices" src="../images/adminUnitTypesDropdown.png" width="282">
		<ol start="4">
			<li>Unit Represent. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of what the unit represents. The default
				choice
				is "quantity". More details are given
				on the <a href="../conversionsUnits/">information on units</a> page. The result of
				clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin unit represent choices" src="../images/adminUnitRepresentDropdown.png" width="288">
		<ol start="5">
			<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of who can see a unit and graph it. It is "all"
				(default) if
				everyone can graph with this unit, "admin" if only admins can graph with this unit and "none" if nobody
				can
				graph with this unit. Note that this will automatically be set to "none" if the type of unit is suffix
				and
				it was "all" when
				the unit is saved. This is not enforced if displayable is "admin" but it is generally best to make it
				"none"
				instead.</li>
			<li>Preferred Display. This dropdown menu can be "yes" (default) or "no". This is currently unused but is
				planned to indicate if this should be a primary unit for
				display to users. </li>
			<li>Sec in Rate. This gives the number of seconds in the unit if "Unit Represent" is flow. It is not used
				for
				quantity and
				raw units so the value can just be left as 3600. For example, if the unit is gallons per minute then
				this
				value is 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute. If it is gallons per hour then this value is 3600
				because there are 3600 seconds in an hour. The default value is 3600. More details are given
				on the <a href="../conversionsUnits/">information on units</a> page.</li>
			<li>Suffix. If blank then this is not a suffix unit (default). Otherwise, it gives the suffix value. More
				details are
				given
				on the <a href="../conversionsUnits/#suffix">conversion and units</a> page. If a suffix is supplied here
				then the unit should be of type "suffix". In the future OED will enforce this.</li>
			<li>Note. This may give additional information about the unit supplied when OED created it or from the
				admin. Any text can be entered and it can be blank if desired.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are two buttons at the bottom of the popup:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard changes. Clicking this button will remove all entries and close the popup. This means the next
				time
				that "Create a Conversion" is clicked all the values will be the default ones. Clicking outside the
				popup
				but
				within the OED web browser window will have the same effect.</li>
			<li>Save all. Clicking this button will save the new conversion with the provided entries.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
		<p>Saving a unit requires a change to the OED database that necessitates a refresh of the web browser window to
			show
			the admin the updated information. As a result, all the currently selected meters/groups/language, etc. will
			be
			lost and the page shown will be the main OED graphic page. OED plans to eliminate the need for doing this in
			the
			future so one would remain on the units page.</p>
