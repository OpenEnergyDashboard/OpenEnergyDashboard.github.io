        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>This page describes the process of importing meters into OED via a CSV file. See the <a
                href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page for an overview and information common to all CSV
            imports.</p>

        <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>The information needed to upload meters is the same whether done via the web page or direct file upload. The
            web
            page looks as follows:</p>
        <img alt="admin CSV meter page" src="../images/adminMeterCSV.png">
        <p></p>

        <h3>Required and optional information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The user name and password is required in the direct file upload as described on the <a
                    href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page. It is automatically provided on the web page
                upload since you are logged in.</li>
            <li><i>CSV file ("Choose File" button on web page; <code>csvFile</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>:
                This gives the location of the CSV file containing the meter information. On the web page it is via a
                file
                picker popup. See below on the file format.</li>
            <li><i>Is CSV file in gzip format ("Gzip" checked if yes on web page; <code>gzip</code> parameter on direct
                    file upload with default value
                    of yes. )</i>: Note this is the Gnu zip format and not a standard .zip file format. Note that gzip
                files are smaller in size for upload and also have internal validation to protect
                against corruption so they are preferred.</li>
            <li><i>Does CSV have a header row ("Header Row" checked if yes on web page; <code>headerRow</code> parameter
                    on
                    direct file upload)</i>: Is the first row of the CSV file header information and not an actual meter
                (see below for format). The default value is no.</li>
            <li><i>Is this an update ("Update" checked if yes on web page; <code>update</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>: Each row is new information for the meter so it will be update with any provided values
                and
                others are left as currently set. The default value is no.</li>
            <li><i>Meter name ("Meter name" input box on web page; <code>meterName</code> parameter on direct file
                    upload)</i>: This is only used if you want to change the name of a meter (not identifier). The meter
                name provided is used as the name to update and the meter name value in the CSV is used as the new name.
                Note you can only update a single meter name at a time meaning that the CSV can only have one row of
                meter
                information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meter CSV file format</h3>
        <p>Meters in OED store a lot of information about them so there are many possible values. If the CSV file has a
            header
            row then it should be:<br>
            name,url,enabled,displayable,type,timezone,gps,identifier,note,area,cumulative,reset,reset start,reset
            end,gap,variation,duplicates,timesort,end only,reading,start time,end time,previous end,unit,default graphic
            unit,area unit,reading freq.<br>
            Currently OED does not use the header row so the names are not crucial but OED may do so in the future so
            using
            these column header names is a good idea. Detailed information on the columns/values are described on the <a
                href="../adminMeterCreating/">admin meter creating</a> page. The order of the items is somewhat
            different
            than those specified for the header row above.
            Each following line should contain the values for one meter in exactly the order listed for the header row
            example above. The column can be blank where the default value
            for OED will be used if the meter creation information does not indicate it is required. Information needed
            for
            CSV
            upload compared to the meter creation page information are:
        <ul>
            <li>When providing a unit one should use the name, e.g., "kWh".</li>
            <li>When providing a value for "type" one should use ones in the drop down menu on the meter creation page,
                e.g,
                "OBVIUS". This is case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>When providing a value for "timesort" use the dropdown menu options of "increasing" and "decreasing".
                This
                is case-sensitive. If no value is provided then the meter is created with the default of increasing.
            </li>
            <li>When inputting the area unit use "feet" or "meters" (Do not include "sq.").</li>
            <li>When providing a value for the "timezone" use the name from the dropdown menu, e.g.,
                "Pacific/Galapagos".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many spreadsheet programs automatically format text that looks like a time or date into a different format.
            In
            general, to avoid this, one should set those fields to be text rather than a time or date. If this is not
            done then you will likely get a format error or unexpected data when you upload a CSV file.</p>
        <p>If you upload a CSV that has missing or incorrect values then it could cause issues. However, some values
            will be
            noted
            with red boxes when you edit this meter and then it can be corrected. For example, if you put in an area but
            not
            a
            unit this will happen. If you have any doubts then it is a good idea to look at the values on the meters
            page to
            verify they are what you wanted.</p>

        <h3>Sample file</h3>
        <p>Below are the lines for a CSV meter import file with a header row and available in this <a
                href="../files/meters.csv" download>meters.csv</a> file. It will import two meters (Meter 1 and My
            Place (identifier) or Meter
            2 (name)) where the meters are not enabled but are displayable. Please note that "3,5" is a pair of values
            separated by a comma that would be in a single column of the CSV file and input without the quotes, i.e.,
            3,5.
            The quotes are added when such a CSV is saved to make it clear that the comma is not a new column. Most
            values that are optional and unspecified so the
            default values are used for Meter 1 but are provided for the second meter. Also note that values that are
            "yes"
            on
            dropdown menus for meter creation must be "true" and values that are "no" must be "false" in this file (but
            not
            the curl command). This file
            can be loaded
            using the curl command of:<br>
            <code>curl https://myoedserver.com:3000/api/csv/meters -X POST -F 'headerRow=yes' -F 'gzip=no' -F 'email=csvuser@myorg.com' -F 'password=csvuserpassword' -F 'csvfile=@meters.csv'</code><br>
            assuming the shown URL, user email and password. (See <a href="../adminReadingsImport/#sampleFiles">admin
                reading sample files</a> for more information on URL, email and password.) You need to reload the OED
            web
            page so your browser is aware of the new meters after a curl import but you will get an empty graphic if
            used
            since they don't have
            any data yet.

        <h3>Return messages</h3>
        <p>What follows are the common messages returned from a meter upload along with their meaning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h1>Successfully inserted the meters.</code></li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe41
            seems to exist when inserting new meters and got DB error of: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
            "meters_name_key"</code><br>
                This normally happens when the name (or similarly identifier) of the meter already exists. It may be the
                case that you wanted to update this meter but did not specify this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name of
            pipe42
            does not seem to exist with update for meters and got DB error of: No data returned from the query.</code><br>
                Request indicated to update meter(s) but at least one did not exist. All meters must exist on update.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/h1&gt;Successfully inserted the meters.&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;CSVPipelineError: Failed to
            upload meters due to internal OED Error: Meter name provided (pipe40) in request with update for meters but
            more than one meter in CSV so not processing</code><br>
                When you want to change a meter name you specify the name in the request as well as the CSV file. It
                then
                uses the name in the request to find the meter and the value in the CSV as the new meter name. However,
                you
                can only have a single meter in the CSV file for this to work. This indicates more than one meter was
                provided.
            </li>
            <li>You can get a variety of error messages if the gzip is improperly set. These include "TypeError",
                "invalid
                message format" and others. This is because OED is incorrectly reading the CSV file and receives garbled
                information.</li>
        </ul>
