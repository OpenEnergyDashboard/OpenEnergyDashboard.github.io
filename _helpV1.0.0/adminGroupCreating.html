		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>The admin group creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to create a new
			group on an OED site. It is accessed from
			the <a href="../adminGroupViewing/">admin group viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
			Group" button near the top of that page.
		</p>
		<img alt="Admin group creating popup" src="../images/adminGroupCreatingPopup.png" width="530">
		<p>All example information shown on this web page is based upon the <a href="../exampleDescription/">help
				example</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Name. This is the name of the group. The name of a group must be different from any other
				group. Though not required it is a good idea to give a group a different name from any meter identifier
				because it can
				be difficult to tell them apart in a graphic if they are the same. This field will be outlined in red
				until a name is input as
				is shown in the figure.</li>
			<li>Default Graphic Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection a compatible <a
					href="../graphingUnits/">graphing unit</a>
				that is used if one is not
				already selected before this group is chosen. It allows a site to automatically display a group in its
				preferred graphic unit. A default
				graphic unit is compatible with the group if a
				conversion exists between all meters in this group and the unit. The compatible/selectable units will be
				at
				the top
				of the dropdown menu and the
				incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. Initially this menu will only
				have "no unit" as compatible because that is the only
				compatible unit with an empty group as shown in the following figure.</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->

		<p>The dropdown menu when the meter "Dining Hall Electric" that collects in kWh is the only child meter is shown
			in the following figure.
			All units from Celsius and below are not compatible and grayed out.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="../images/adminGroupDguEuDropdown.png" width="281">
		<p>If "no unit" is selected then this group cannot be graphed until a compatible unit is already selected. It
			has a default value of "no unit".</p>
		<ol start="3">
			<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). "yes" indicates the group
				can be seen and graphed by any user and "no" limits the group visibility and graphing to admins.</li>
			<li>GPS. This is the GPS location of the group entered as latitude, longitude (without parentheses). It is
				used
				when the values from
				the group are placed on a <a href="../mapGraphic/">map graphic</a>. More information on using the best
				GPS
				value is given on the <a href="../adminMapCreating/">admin help page for creating maps</a>. If blank
				then
				there is no
				GPS value and the group cannot be placed on a map.</li>
			<li>Area. A non-negative number of the area associated with the group. It is used when <a
					href="../areaNormalization/">normalizing graphics by area</a>. It has a default value of zero
				that means this group cannot be normalized by area. The default value will be used if the input is left
				blank.
				This field will be outlined in red until valid value (including blank) is entered if an invalid value is
				entered.</li>
			<li>Calculate Group Area. Knowing the total area that all meters in a group represents can be complex.To
				help
				with this, OED can automatically calculate the area of the group from all the included meters (not just
				the
				directly included ones). The group
				must have an "Area Unit" (not "no unit"
				) to be able to do this and a popup will say "No group area unit" if there is no area unit set. Note
				that
				the
				underlying meters can be in any area unit but OED can still calculate
				the value in the unit requested. Clicking this button will cause OED to calculate this area and it will
				then
				display the resulting value. For example, if the group contains "Dining Hall Electric", "Great Dorm 1st
				Floor
				Electric" And "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" then clicking this button will result in the popup in the
				next
				figure.</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="../images/adminGroupAreaCalc.png" width="445">
		<p>If one clicks "OK" (the default) then the value for area display will be placed in the area input and it will
			overwrite any existing value. If one clicks "Cancel" then nothing is changed. In this example the area is
			11000 because the area of "Dining Hall Electric" is 1000, "Great Dorm 1st Floor
			Electric" is 5000 and "Great Dorm 2nd Floor Electric" is 5000 so the sum is 11000.</p>
		<p>It is not required that all meters have an associated area. If a group includes such a meter then OED will
			give a warning when it calculates the area of the group because it cannot include anything for that meter.
			If the
			previous example was modified to include a fourth meter of "Other building" that does not have an area then
			the
			popup in the next figure would appear when you calculate the area.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group unit choices" src="../images/adminGroupAreaCalcNoArea.png" width="445">
		<p>As stated, the area calculated does not include anything for this meter. Note if one clicks "OK" and sets the
			area for this group, it is possible to manually edit this value to include any missing meters. While this
			example shows one meter, any meters without an area will be listed in the popup.</p>
		<ol start="7">
			<li>Area Unit. This dropdown menu can have the values shown in the following figure. The usable area units
				are "sq. feet" and "sq. meters". If "no unit" is selected then the field will be red if the area is
				non-zero
				because OED needs to know the unit of the area. The default value is "no unit" and this can be used if
				the
				area is reset back to zero so the choice is valid.</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Reuse meter one since menu is the same. -->
		<img alt="Admin group area unit choices" src="../images/adminMeterAreaUnitDropdown.png" width="155">
		<ol start="8">
			<li>Note. This may give additional information about the group supplied by the
				admin. Any text can be entered and it can be blank if desired.</li>
			<li>Child Meters. This area lists all the meters directly included into this group along with the ability to
				change them. A meter can be removed by clicking the "x" to the right of its name. The dropdown menu can
				be
				used to select another meter to include into this group. A meter is compatible with the group if a
				conversion exists between all meters in this group and the meter. Unlike many dropdown menus in OED, all
				the
				possible meters are listed alphabetically because there are several possible states for any meter. In
				the
				following figure, an example is shown where the "Dining Hall Electric" meter is already a member of this
				group and the default graphic unit is "no unit". This meter collects in kWh (energy unit) and is
				compatible
				with energy, CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $. The meters shown
				are displayed as
				follows (there are more meters in the dropdown menu that are not shown):
				<ul>
					<li>Adding this meter to the group will not change the group's possible compatible units. Such
						meters
						are
						shown in regular font and are selectable. In the following figure, "Library Electric" and
						"Theater
						Electric" are displayed this way because they are all collecting in an energy unit (kWh) and are
						completely compatible with each other.</li>
					<li>Adding this meter to the group will change the group's possible compatible units but the reduced
						compatible units still include the current default graphic unit. Such meters are
						shown in orange font and are selectable. In the following figure, "Great Dorm Water" is
						displayed
						this way and is compatible with volume units,
						CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $. This group and the already selected meter are both compatible
						with
						CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $ so energy units will no longer be compatible. Selecting this meter
						is
						compatible with the default graphic unit because it is currently "no unit".</li>
					<li>Adding this meter to the group will change the group's possible compatible units so there are no
						compatible units. If OED allowed such a group then it could never be graphed
						so it is not
						allowed. Thus, the incompatible/non-selectable meters will be in grayed out font. In the
						following
						figure, "Library Temperature" is displayed this way because it is collecting in a temperature
						unit
						(Fahrenheit) and is not compatible only with temperature units. These are not
						compatible with any of the "Dining Hall Electric" meter units
						so there are no possible compatible units between them.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group child meter choices" src="../images/adminGroupChildMeters.png" width="573">
		<p>The fourth possible display state of a meter is shown in the following figure. In this case the default
			graphic unit was changed to kWh. As a result, the meter "Great Dorm Water" is now in red. This
			indicates that the compatible units would change if this meter
			is selected and the current default
			graphic unit is not one of the changed compatible units (CO<sub>2</sub> units and US $). If this meter
			is chosen then the default
			graphic unit
			must be changed. OED will set the default graph unit to "no unit" and one needs to set it to a new
			compatible unit for this group if desired. These meters are shown in red to indicate that the group will
			automatically
			be changed. If the new meter is added to the group then a pop up will confirm the change to the group.
			In this example it would have "The default graphic unit was changed to no unit from "kWh"".</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin group child meter choices" src="../images/adminGroupChildMetersRed.png" width="526">
		<p>While the examples above use meters, any group included in this group also impacts the compatible units.
			Any of
			the meters that are in this group (see All Meters below) are included in the consideration of compatible
			units. Finally, a meter can always be removed from a group because it cannot reduce the compatible units
			so it will leave it the same or add more compatible units.</p>
		<ol start="10">
			<li>Child Groups. This area lists all the groups directly included into this group along with the ability to
				change them. A group can be removed by clicking the "x" to the right of its name. The dropdown menu can
				be
				used to select another group to include into this group. A group is compatible with the new group if a
				conversion exists between all meters in this group and all meters in the new group. Thus, the dropdown
				menu
				to select a new group has the same choices as the "Child Meters" dropdown menu and they represent the
				same
				thing. Because groups can contain multiple meters, it can be more difficult for one to determine the
				compatibility of groups but OED will do this automatically. The next figure shows what the group
				dropdown
				menu looks like from the first example in the Child Meters where the default graphic unit is "no unit".
				There are more groups below the ones shown.
				The reason for the group labeling can be determined by looking at the information in the <a
					href="../exampleDescription/">help example</a> and <a
					href="../conversionsUnits/#compatible">compatibility</a> .</li>
		</ol>
		<img alt="Admin group group choices" src="../images/adminGroupChildGroupsRed.png" width="634">
		<ol start="11">
			<li>All Meters. Determining all meters that are included in a group can be difficult, especially given that
				groups can include groups (and those can include more groups). To help with this, this area shows all
				meters
				that are included in this group
				from all directly included meters and groups. The following figure shows the result for all meters for
				the
				meters and groups shown that will be included in this group. The reason for these meters can be
				determined
				by
				looking at the information in the <a href="../exampleDescription/">help example</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<img alt="Admin all meters" src="../images/adminGroupAllMeters.png" width="568">
		<p>There are two buttons at the bottom of the popup:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard changes. Clicking this button will remove all entries and close the popup. This means the next
				time
				that "Create a Group" is clicked all the values will be the default ones. Clicking outside the popup but
				within the OED web browser window will have the same effect.</li>
			<li>Save all. Clicking this button will save the new group with the provided entries.</li>
