		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>There are times you want to have more space for graphics by docking the options/menus normally listed on the
			left-hand side of the OED pages. This may be desired when you have a smaller screen/resolution, you are
			displaying on a monitor without interactivity or you simply want more space for the graphics. When you dock
			these items, they can be undocked from the "Menu" button on the top, right corner of the OED screen where
			there
			is an option to "Show options" (undock) the options/menus.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>OED will automatically dock the menus if the size of your web browser window is too small. This can happen
			due to
			resizing the window or from the screen resolution/size. When this is done there will not be the option to
			either
			hide or show options. If you wish to manually dock the options/menus, then use
			the "Hide options" choice under the "Options" choices in the top, right of the OED window (highlighted in
			blue
			box) as shown in this figure:</p>
		<img alt="Hide options" src="../images/hideOptions.png">
		<p>When this is done, the screen will change as shown in the figure below (without the popup shown). The figure
			below shows the result of clicking on the
			"Menu" button in the top, right corner of the window (highlighted in light blue box). The "Show options"
			choice
			under "Options" (highlighted in blue box) on the popup can be clicked to undock the
			options/menus to put them back on the left side of the window as shown in the figure above. As seen, the
			option
			that used to be on the left side of the OED graphics page are now in this pop up.</p>

		<p>The "Toggle chart link" button has an option to hide the menu when you create the link. See the <a
				href="../chartLink/">chart link page</a> for more information.</p>
