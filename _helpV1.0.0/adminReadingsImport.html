    <h1>Admin Reading Import (Help)</h1>
    
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>This page describes the process of importing readings into OED via a CSV file. See the <a
            href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page for an overview and information common to all CSV
        imports.</p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>The information needed to upload readings is the same whether done via the web page or direct file upload. The
        web
        page looks as follows:</p>
    <img alt="admin CSV meter page" src="../images/adminReadingCSV.png">
    <p>The items with a dropdown menu generally have the option of "meter value or default" and it is preselected. This
        choice causes OED to use the value stored on the meter which should be the default value if none was ever
        supplied. An input box on the web page begins empty and this will cause OED to use the value stored on the meter
        which should be the default value if none was ever supplied. If a parameter is not supplied in a direct file
        upload then it defaults to the meter value. The check boxes at the end of the page above do not have meter
        default values and use the OED default value if not supplied. See the <a
            href="../adminMeterCreating/#usage">meters
            creation</a> page for details on the parameters with equivalent meter values along with default values. Any
        differences are noted with
        each item. The required and optional
        information is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user name and password is required in the direct file upload as described on the <a
                href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page. It is automatically provided on the web page
            upload since one is logged in.</li>
        <li><i>Meter name ("Meter name" input box on web page; <code>meterName</code> parameter on direct file
                upload)</i>: This value is required and there is no default.</li>
        <li><i>Time sort ("Time Sort" drop down menu on web page; <code>TimeSort</code> parameter on direct file
                upload)</i>: If unspecified then it uses the
            value stored on the meter. Note that when decreasing, OED processes from the last line in the CSV to the
            first line. This is not normally important to users but note that if an error occurs and processing stops,
            you will not see messages about earlier lines in the CSV.</li>
        <li><i># of times a reading is duplicated ("Duplications" drop down menu on web page; <code>duplications</code>
                parameter on direct file upload)</i>: On the web page the drop down
            menu is set to 1 by default. If unspecified in direct file upload it will use the meter value which defaults
            to 1.</li>
        <li><i>CSV file ("Choose File" button on web page; <code>csvFile</code> parameter on direct file upload)</i>:
            This gives the location of the CSV file containing the meter information. On the web page it is via a file
            picker popup. See below on the file format.</li>
        <li><i>Are the readings cumulative ("Cumulative" drop down menu on web page; <code>cumulative</code> parameter
                on direct file
                upload)</i>: If unspecified then it uses the
            value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li><i>Do cumulative readings ever reset ("Cumulative Reset" drop down menu on web page;
                <code>cumulativeReset</code>
                parameter on direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter. Note specifying cumulative reset without cumulative
            is considered an error.
        </li>
        <li><i>Earliest time that cumulative reset occurs ("Cumulative Reset Start" input box on web page;
                <code>cumulativeResetStart</code> parameter on direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li><i>Latest time that cumulative reset occurs ("Cumulative Reset End" input box on web page;
                <code>cumulativeResetEnd</code> parameter on direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li>How far apart can adjacent readings be<i> ("Length Gap" input box on web page; <code>lengthGap</code>
                parameter on
                direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li><i>How much can adjacent readings vary in time length ("Length Variation" on web page;
                <code>lengthVariation</code> parameter on direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li><i>Do readings only have an end date/time ("End Only times" drop down on web page; <code>endOnly</code>
                parameter on
                direct file upload)</i>: If
            unspecified then it uses the value stored on the meter.</li>
        <li><i>Should OED create the meter ("Create Meter" checked if yes on web page; <code>createMeter</code>
                parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: If this value is "yes" then the specified meter will be created if it does not
            already exist. An automatically created meter will have the default values for meters and this can be
            modified
            later. Note that the meter will not be assigned a meter unit so it cannot be used for graphing until that is
            set. If the meter already exists and this is "yes" then a warning is placed in the OED logs (but
            not returned as part of the messages). If set "no" but the meter does not exist then OED throws an error
            that will stop the readings upload so no readings are processed. Note that the meter is created before the
            readings are processed so it will exist even if the readings are later reject. The default value
            is "no".</li>
        <li><i>Is CSV file in gzip format ("Gzip" checked if yes on web page; <code>gzip</code> parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: Note this is the Gnu zip format and not a standard .zip file format. The default value
            is yes. Note that gzip files are smaller in size for upload and also have internal validation to protect
            against corruption so they are preferred.</li>
        <li><i>Does CSV have a header row ("Header Row" checked if yes on web page; <code>headerRow</code> parameter on
                direct file upload)</i>: Is the first row of the CSV file header information and not an actual reading
            (see below for format). The default value is no.</li>
        <li><i>Is this an update ("Update" checked if yes on web page; <code>update</code> parameter on direct file
                upload)</i>: Any readings in the CSV that duplicate the start and end date/time values of ones already
            in
            OED (same start time/date) will be
            replaced with the provided reading if this is "yes". Any new readings in the CSV will be added. If it is
            "no" then duplicate readings cause an
            error and all readings in the CSV are rejected. Note OED rejects all readings to be conservative about
            changing data. Note that using update removes the previous data and it is lost within OED. Thus, care should
            be taken in using the update option and it is often safer to limit the items uploaded to avoid issues. The
            default value is "no".</li>
        <li><i>Should OED refresh its internally stored daily readings after the upload ("Refresh Readings" checked if
                yes on
                web page; <code>refreshReadings</code> parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: OED does optimization on uploaded readings so it can quickly respond to user requests
            for data. While this process does not take long, it can briefly slow the server down. Also, it only makes a
            difference if a day worth of readings is available. This means it only makes a difference if readings are
            uploaded for a new day or reading(s) are changed for a previous day. Doing this when the current day is only
            partly uploaded will not have any effect. Normally, the OED server is set up to
            automatically do this process a little after midnight on each day so the previous day's readings are
            optimized and displayed. However, there may be times where you upload data that you want to be available
            immediately after the CSV upload. Setting refresh readings to "yes" will accomplish this. Note this assumes
            you are looking at a graphic that deals with complete days (which is the most common) and have not zoomed in
            to a subset of the data that makes OED show sub-day data. The default value
            is no.</li>
        <li><i>Should OED refresh its internally stored hourly readings after the upload ("Refresh Hourly Readings"
                checked if yes on
                web page; <code>refreshHourlyReadings</code> parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: This is similar to refresh readings except it does the hourly ones. These are slower
            to
            refresh but allow the user to see the data on an hourly basis when they zoom into the graph. If this is not
            done then the hourly data will not show any of the uploaded data.</li>
        <li><i>Should OED detect and honor daylight savings time while processing these readings ("Honor Daylight
                Savings Time" checked if yes on web page; <code>honorDst</code> parameter on direct
                file upload)</i>: Should OED honor daylight savings time and appropriately adjust readings when this
            occurs for this batch of readings. The default value
            is no.
        </li>
        <li><i>Should OED not enforce standard checks on parsing date/time values and allow a more flexible
                interpretation
                of these values ("Relaxed Parsing" checked if yes on web page; <code>relaxedParsing</code> parameter on
                direct
                file upload)</i>: When this is set OED may be able to interpret certain formats of date/time values
            that it would normally reject. While this can be helpful it can be risky because invalid values may still be
            interpreted as a valid date/time value. It is better to give the values in the standard format of YYYY-MM-DD
            HH:MM:SS if at all possible. The default value
            is no.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reading CSV file format</h3>
    <p>If the file has a header row then it should be:<br>
        reading, start_timestamp, end_timestamp<br>
        Each following line should contain the values for one reading which are:
    <ol>
        <li><i>reading value</i>: This is the usage between the start date/time and end data/time in the units expected
            for this meter. Note a reading that is not an integer or real number will cause an error where OED then
            rejects all readings in the CSV file.</li>
        <li><i>start_timestamp</i>: (This assumes end only time is no.) This is the start date/time value for this
            readings. (The name of the column is
            historical and is not just time). OED accepts any format that our date/time package can accept where most
            usual formats are recognized. The canonical format is 2021-06-01 00:00:00 (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). Note you
            can put the time before the date, use "/" in place of "-" in the date, and/or not include the seconds
            (HH:MM). The system should also detect and accept date in a MM-DD-YYYY format. The system tries to detect
            incorrect formats/dates/times and this causes OED to reject all readings
            in the CSV file. For example, 2021-06-32 00:00:00 will cause an error since there are not 32 days in June.
        </li>
        <li><i>end_timestamp</i>: Similar to start_timestamp but specifies the end date/time value for this reading.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note the start_timestamp column will not be present if end only is specified. Also, the input format for CSV
        files is compatible with the export format used. As a result, line graphic data that is exported from OED can be
        reimported through the CSV ability.</p>

    <h3 id="sampleFiles">Sample files</h3>
    <p>For each sample given, there is a link to the CSV file and the curl parameters used to upload that CSV file. The
        same parameters could be set via the web upload. The
        curl command one will use will be:<br>
        <code>curl &lt;yourOedServer&gt;:3000/api/csv/readings -X POST -F 'createMeter=yes' -F 'meterName=&lt;meterName&gt;' &lt;curlParameters&gt; -F 'email=&lt;loginEmail&gt;' -F 'password=&lt;loginPassword&gt;' -F 'csvfile=@&lt;csvFilename&gt;'</code><br>
        where you replace &lt;yourOedServer&gt; with your OED server URL address (same as when you go to your OED site),
        &lt;meterName&gt; with the name you want OED to use for this meter, &lt;curlParameters&gt; with the curl
        parameters
        listed for each sample file, &lt;loginEmail&gt; with the user email
        with CSV user login privileges for OED, &lt;loginPassword&gt; with the password for that
        user and &lt;csvFilename&gt; with the CSV file name listed for the sample file. Note the curl command must be
        run
        in the directory containing the CSV file or include the path to that file. As an example for the first sample
        file, you might have<br>
        <code>curl https://myoedserver.come:3000/api/csv/readings -X POST -F 'createMeter=yes' -F 'meterName=regAsc' -F 'headerRow=yes' -F 'gzip=no' -F 'email=csvuser@myorg.com' -F 'password=csvuserpassword' -F 'csvfile=@regAsc.csv'</code><br>
        assuming the shown URL, user email and password and making the meter name be the base of the CSV file name (file
        name
        without .csv). Note that meters created by OED are not visible to non-admin users so you will either need to be
        logged in as an admin or get an admin user to make the meter(s) visible. Also, an admim user needs to refresh
        the readings for them to be able to be graphed (often happens automatically somewhat after midnight on a site).
        As an alternative (if it is okay for your server) you can add the parameters
        <code>-F 'refreshReadings=yes' -F 'refreshHourlyReadings=yes'</code> so
        OED will do the refresh as part of the upload.
        Finally, you need to reload the OED web page so your browser is aware of the new meters and data. Please see <a
            href="#valueShown">CSV vs graphic value</a> discussion about expected values in OED graphs.

    <p>Below are the lines for a CSV readings import file with a header row where end only is no and the data is not
        cumulative. It will import three readings with values of 24, 48 and 72 for 1-3 June 2021. Note that the end
        date/time is at midnight of the next day. (This <a href="../files/regAsc.csv" download>regAsc.csv</a> was loaded

    <p>Below are the lines for a CSV readings import file with a header row where end only is no, the data is not
        cumulative and update is yes. It is assumed that the first example (two above) was run first so the reading
        values of 24, 48 & 72 already exist in OED. The second row of the CSV (first with a reading) will create a new
        reading for 31 May 2021
        with a reading value of 0. This is the assumed previous reading in the following cumulative examples and has the
        date for the previous reading with end only times in the following examples. The third row of the CSV will
        modify (update) the current reading
        for 1 June 2021 to change the value from 24 to 36. The fourth row of the CSV will update the reading for 2 June
        2021 but since the reading provided is the same as the one already in OED you cannot see that this was done.
        Note you get a warning returned by OED since the first reading is before the last upload for this meter but this
        does not change the outcome.

        returns an error message about that.
        The second row is calculated by OED to be 72 - 24 = 48 and the third as 144 - 72 =

        other readings all have the row reading greater than or equal to the previous row reading so no reset occurred.
        Note the request could set the reset time start and end to be
        close to midnight (23:55 & 00:05 if must be within 5 minutes of midnight) if you want to avoid OED assuming a

        the
        same except all rows past the first header row are in reverse order so time decreases as you go down the rows.
        An example without cumulative is not shown but it would be similar but have reading values of 72, 48 & 24 for
        rows 2-4 (but here the first reading of 24 would not be dropped). (This <a href="../files/cumDsc.csv"

    <h3>Return messages</h3>
    <p>Most messages end with some standard information that can help you (and if needed the OED project)
        understand what happened. If there are issues, the beginning of the message will have:<br>
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;FAILURE&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It looks like the insert of the readings had issues with some or all of the
        readings where the processing of the readings returned these warning(s)/error(s):&lt;/h2&gt;</code><br>
        The later part of the message will normally include what OED thought was the
        previous and current reading along with the parameter values it is using for processing. This is an
        example:<br>
        <code>For reading #1 on meter pipe3 in pipeline: previous reading has value 0 start time
        1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 end time 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 and current reading has value 24 start time
        2021-06-01T00:00:00+00:00 end time 2021-06-02T00:00:00+00:00 with timeSort increasing; duplications 1;
        cumulative true; cumulativeReset false; cumulativeResetStart 00:00:00; cumulativeResetEnd 23:59:59.999999;
        lengthGap 0; lengthVariation 0; onlyEndTime false</code><br>
        In this case, the previous reading was the default one set by OED to indicate that no meter reading has yet
        been saved. This can be seen from the date of 1970-01-01. Note all parameters are shown even if they are not
        used in this circumstance. For example, the cumulateResetStart/End is given even though cumulativeReset is
        false.<br>
        Additional information included in all messages will be a list of dropped readings at the end of the
        message. Note these are not given if all readings are dropped (indicated in message). An example where the first
        reading is dropped is:<br>
        <code>&lt;h2&gt;Readings Dropped and should have previous messages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dropped Reading #1 for
        meter pipe3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>What follows are the common messages returned from a reading upload along with their meaning. The standard
        information in messages just described is not included in what is given.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe3: Error parsing
            Reading #1. Reading value gives 24 with error message:<br>The first ever reading must be dropped when
            dealing with cumulative data.</code><br>
            This is expected when the first ever cumulative reading is added to a meter. The message will also indicate
            that Reading #1 was dropped. See <a href="#first">first ever reading</a> below.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe6: Error parsing Reading #4. Reading value of 96 gives -48 with error message:<br>A negative meterReading has been detected but either cumulativeReset is not enabled, or the start time and end time of this reading is out of the reset range. Reject all readings.</code><br>
            With cumulative data, the current reading value is calculated as the current reading value minus the
            previous reading value. In this case the current reading value is 96 and the previous reading value is 144
            so the calculated reading value is 96 - 144 = -48. In the message the previous reading value is given as 72
            because this was the calculated reading value but OED uses the original, raw reading value (144) to do
            the actual calculation. Having the raw cumulative value decrease is not allowed unless cumulativeReset is
            yes and happens within the allowed time range. You can tell which of the possible reasons for the message
            (cumulativeReset is no or not within the allowed time range) by looking at the values for the current and
            previous reading. To make sure that incorrect values are not added to OED, no
            reading from this CSV are added to OED and this is indicated in the message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe50: Error parsing Reading #3. Detected a negative value while handling cumulative readings so all reading are rejected.</code><br>
            Unlike the case above, this case is where the actual meter readings (not the net value calculated by OED) is
            negative for cumulative readings. Since OED subtracts readings, a negative value will make a reading larger
            and this is not normal. As a result, OED is cautious and assumes an error and rejects all readings as a
            result.
            Note that OED will let you know if the previous reading was from the meter (this is used in the first
            reading in the
            CSV) by giving the message as
            <code>The last meter reading (logical previous reading) was negative with value -1 with cumulative readings the previous reading cannot be negative so all reading are rejected.</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe13: Warning parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with warning message:<br>The previous reading has a different time length than the current reading and exceeds the tolerance of 0 seconds. Note this is treated only as a warning since this may be expected for certain meters.</code><br>
            The time length of a reading is the end time minus the start time. If this exceeds the value for the
            lengthVariation parameter than a warning is generated. In this case the lengths varied and the allowed time
            length
            variation was zero so the message was given. This is only a warning for several reasons. First, some meters
            vary in when values are acquired so some variation in the reading time length is expected. Second, changes
            in variation still allow OED to determine all needed values. Note that OED detects when the previous reading
            is the special one where the meter has never recorded a reading and will not report that case as a warning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe16: Warning parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with warning message:<br>There is a gap in time between this reading and the previous reading that exceeds the allowed amount of 0 seconds.</code><br>
            The reading gap is the difference between the start time of the current reading and the end time of the
            previous reading. In this case they differ and the lengthGap parameter was zero so that generated the
            message. This is only a warning since OED can still correctly determine the reading value. Note that OED
            detects when the previous reading
            is the special one where the meter has never recorded a reading and will not report that case as a warning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe48: Error parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with error message:<br>The end of the previous reading is too far from the start of the next readings in cumulative data so drop this reading.</code><br>
            Unlike non-cumulative data above, in the case of cumulative data where there is a gap between readings that
            exceeds lengthGap it is an error. This is because OED uses the difference between the current and previous
            reading's value to get the net reading for use in OED. Where there is a gap it may indicate missing time so
            this calculation is not trusted. As a result, OED drops this reading.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe38: Warning parsing Reading #1. Reading value gives 0 with warning message:<br>The current reading startTime is not after the previous reading's end time. Note this is treated only as a warning since readings may be sent out of order.<br>There is a gap in time between this reading and the previous reading that exceeds the allowed amount of 0 seconds.</code><br>
            OED expects readings to come in chronologically increasing time. If the start time of the current reading is
            before the previous readings end time then a warning is generated. Note there is often a second warning
            about a gap between the readings since that is also present (see above about gaps between readings). This
            can happen if two different reading uploads are not done in order such as loading readings from past so it
            is only a warning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe49: Error parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with error message:<br>The reading start time is before the previous end time and the data is cumulative so OED cannot use this reading.</code><br>
            Unlike non-cumulative data above, in the case of cumulative data where the current reading is not after the
            previous reading it is an error. This is because OED uses the difference between the current and previous
            reading's value to get the net reading for use in OED. When the readings are out of time order this may
            indicate the two readings are not consecutive so
            this calculation is not trusted. As a result, OED drops this reading.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe43: Error parsing Reading #2 The start and/or end time provided did not parse into a valid date/time so all reading are rejected.</code><br>
            OED checks that the dates/times provided for the current reading are in a valid format. If not, this error
            is
            generated. To make sure that incorrect values are not added to OED, no
            reading from this CSV are added to OED and this is indicated in the message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe47: Error parsing Reading #4 The reading value provided of 9a is not considered a number so all reading are rejected.</code><br>
            Similarly to checking the date/time, OED makes sure the reading value is a valid number. If not, this error
            is
            generated where the value was "9a" here. To make sure that incorrect values are not added to OED, no
            reading from this CSV are added to OED and this is indicated in the message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe51: Error parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with error message:<br>The reading end time is not after the start time.</code><br>
            A reading must span some amount of time so it is invalid to have an end time that is not after the start
            time. This is an error and the current reading is dropped. If you have endOnly readings then the start time
            of the current reading comes from the end time of the previous reading and OED will inform you of this as
            part of the message. This does not change how OED deals with this error.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>For meter pipe52: Error parsing Reading #2. Reading value gives 48 with error message:<br>The reading end time is not after the start time so we must drop the reading. The start time came from the previous readings end time.</code><br>
            This is for endOnly as yes. The current reading's start time comes from the previous reading's end time. As
            above, this means that the current reading's end time must be after the previous reading's end time and the
            reading is dropped. Note that you may get warnings about reading length variation and/or gaps for the next
            two
            points due to this one being off. This includes the fact that the next reading will use the this end reading
            so it may span the wrong amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;WARNING - The total number of messages was stopped due to size.' +
                ' The log file has all the messages.&lt;/h1&gt; The current message &lt;h1&gt;Message lost starting now.&lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
            When processing a CSV file, it is possible that there will be a large number of messages (warnings and/or
            errors). For example, forgetting to make cumulative yes can cause many lines to be rejected for negative
            values. To avoid returning a message of excessive size, OED limits the total message to about 75,000
            characters which is normally 75 or more unique messages. This should give sufficient information about what
            is going on but any remaining messages that are truncated will be seen once the earlier issues are resolved
            but note they are always present in the OED log file on your OED server. You will see something similar to
            the
            message above except "The current message" will be replaced by the message OED is currently issuing for that
            row of the CSV file.
        </li>
        <li>You can get a variety of error messages if the gzip is improperly set. These include "TypeError", "invalid
            message format" and others. This is because OED is incorrectly reading the CSV file and receives garbled
            information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
    <p>This provides further information on loading CSV readings into OED. Note many apply to the code for loading
        readings into OED so apply even if it is done outside this CSV mechanism.</p>

    <h3>See readings after CSV uploaded </h3>
    <p>One needs to reload the web browser pages as described <a href="../adminCsvImport/#reload">here</a>. One also
        will not see values if a refresh was needed and not performed.</p>

    <h3 id="first">First reading ever seen by a meter</h3>
    <p>OED uses the previous value to validate reading length and the gap to the previous reading. It also uses the
        previous reading to determine the current reading's value for cumulative readings. There is a startup issue when
        a meter is first
        created concerning what the previous reading will be. As described on the <a href="../adminMetersImport/">CSV
            meter import</a> page, OED sets the previous reading to have start/end dates/times of 1970-01-01 00:00:00
        and a reading of zero. This should make it the case that this is well before any actual meter reading and
        OED uses this special value to detect when a meter has never had a reading added. Due to this, if the reading is
        either
        cumulative and/or end only date/time then it must be discarded. This is because there is no real previous
        point to use to get the needed values. OED will report that the CSV upload failed and tell you it dropped
        the first reading as needed. Note that OED will be fine after the first ever reading since it will use the
        first ever reading as the previous reading when it does the second reading.</p>

    <h3>CSV file that is not immediately after the last previous reading</h3>
    <p>OED uses the previous reading to do calculations and validation of a reading. If you
        upload a CSV where the first reading is not the next reading for this meter you will see issues for similar
        reasons to the first ever reading described above. This includes OED warning about a gap, possibly a warning
        about the reading being earlier in time than the previous reading (if that is yes), and possible rejection
        of the reading if this is cumulative data and/or end only data. As described above, the next reading in the
        CSV will be handled without these issues. Note you can get these issues if the previous CSV upload was
        rejected (all readings) because OED does not update the previous reading in this case (to avoid mistakes).
        Thus, the previous reading stays as what it was before the upload of this CSV. This can be fixed by
        addressing the issue(s) with the CSV and uploading again before the next CSV upload of later data. As noted
        on the <a href="../adminCsvImport/">general CSV import</a> page, OED returns messages to let you know that
        an issue occurred and direct file upload will return an error code.</p>

    <h3 id=valueShown>Reading value in CSV vs what is seen in OED</h3>
    <p>OED displays data per unit time in a line graph. In the CSV example files above, each reading spans one day
        or 24 hours. Thus, if this was electricity readings in KW, OED would, by default, graph KW/hour and each value
        in the CSV
        will show up as 1/24 of the value provided when graphed by OED. In the sample values, 24, 48 and 72 (KW for
        24 hours) will be shown on a line graphic as 1, 2 and 3 (KWh). OED does a sophisticated average where it
        proportionally includes part of a reading's value if it crosses the boundary of the time range of the point
        being graphed. In general you do not need to worry about this but it is mentioned so people will not think
        that OED should show the CSV file value directly.</p>

    <h3>Cumulative data and resets</h3>
    <p>For OED to get the usage during any time period for cumulative data, it must subtract the previous reading from
        the current one. When a reset occurs, OED assumes the previous reading was zero which means it uses the current
        reading as the usage for the period represented by this reading. Since there is no alternative, OED assumes the
        current reading began the period with a reading of zero. If the reset occurs in the middle of a reading, OED
        will not include any usage before the reset happened it this period. Meters should not do resets in the middle
        of a reading but it would cause inaccuracies for that reading if it did.</p>

    <h3>Row numbers in returned messages</h3>
    <p>OED tries to return the row (line) number of the CSV when it reports any messages. First, OED strips off the
        header row so that is not counted in the row number. This means the second row in a CSV file (assuming time
        sort is ascending) will be shown as row #1. Note that when time sort is descending, OED still reports the
        row numbers in the same way (even though it processes the data from the last to first row).</p>

    <h3>Using dropped readings as the previous reading</h3>
    <p>If all readings are dropped then the previous reading associated with the meter is not updated and no changes
        are stored for any readings. In all other cases, the previous reading associated with the meter is updated with
        the last reading in the CSV file. Note that OED should use the previous row in the CSV as the previous readings
        even if it is dropped. The reason is that readings generally come in time order so removing one will cause the
        next reading to generate an error. Thus, the bad reading is used for processing a next reading but is not stored
        as a reading in OED.</p>
